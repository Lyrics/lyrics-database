### So this is yet another lyrics website?
Not quite. Think of it as a fan sourced tribute to music with words. Nothing but lyrics submitted by you and other GitHub users, all in one place, free to access by anyone, at any time.

### What's the ultimate goal?
Improve the overall quality of lyrics available on the Internet.

### Is there a website that uses this database?
There is, it can be found here: https://lyrics.github.io. It has no ads, no ugly miniscule fonts,
no clipboard injections, no malware, no analytics or heart-breaking censorship, just lyrics.

### What makes you think your database is not going to end up being exactly like all the others?
Git lets many users with various music tastes contribute and correct texts of their favorite songs. Also, money is not involved here, it's a hobby project driven in its entirety by admiration of music and poetry. Lyrics websites are generally maintained by a handful of people, and they tend to strive toward quantity rather than quality (more content equals higher position within search engines, equals bigger ad revenue). Ideally there will be lots and lots of contributors from all around the world, which should result in this project one day becoming the most multilingual lyrics resource available on the Internet.

### Are lyrics here the same as anywhere else?
Not exactly. Many great but not mainstream artists have no lyrics available online. Unless their texts are easy to write out, we get in touch with those artists and ask to share lyrics from the original source.

### What's the current plan?
Receive more content contributions to eventually make results from the open lyrics database website show up high within search results. Overall quality is extremely important as well, therefore there's going to be more work done on tests and the website.

### How is this different from other websites where users can contribute lyrics?
One big advantage here is that you can save the whole database to your disk in just two clicks, while other websites can go offline at any time with all their lyrics becoming inaccessible to the public. That alone makes every contribution to this repository a solid and permanent improvement for the Internet as a whole.

### What if other lyrics resources will just start taking lyrics from here?
It's likely that both fans and artists who would ever contribute to this database will do so as a gesture of good will, therefore contributors would likely be happy to know that other websites are sourcing lyrics from this database as long as they retain proper credits and copyright messages.

### Do you censor things in here?
Negatronic.
