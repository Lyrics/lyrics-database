Rushing through thirty
Getting older every day by two
Drawing pictures
Of innocent times
Can you add colour
Inside these lines

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

Sure, if we change my perspective
I’m certain I will change today
I’m certain it will change our ways
When things fall into place

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

I want you to lead me
Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day

Take me somewhere
Don’t want to live
In a dream one more day
