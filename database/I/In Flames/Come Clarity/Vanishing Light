A vanishing light
The end of a compromise
A fury and rage
A dream will be managed

Beyond getting them in lines
Learn to survive
A fine way to
Make friends and a place to call home

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

We’ll slide away and
Learn your ways
We’ll fire when ready
This is the race
To no mans land
But in no set direction

You’re on the easy route
Money a front, theres no doubt

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

We’ll slide away and
Learn your ways
We’ll fire when ready
This is the race
To no mans land
But in no set direction

Its so, so sad
But pay no mind

Take a picture and
Jump before we crash
Take a picture and
Jump before we crash

We’ll slide away and
Learn your ways
We’ll fire when ready
This is the race
To no mans land
But in no set direction
