When all is said and done
We know what’s right, what’s wrong
But does it matter then
When all is said and done?

When all is said and done
We know who who lost who won
But does it matter then
When all is dead and gone?

Seeing everything go
End of all things
And life as we know it
Shift your point of view
You’ve been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all the lights go out
We know what that’s about
But does it matter then
When all the lights go out?

When all that’s left is lies
There’ll be nothing
Left to realize
But does it matter do
They know they left its lies

Seeing everything go
End of all things
And life as we know it
Shift your point of view
You’ve been warned
This one way ticket is for you

When all that’s left is lies
We’ll see nothing
Left to realize
But does it matter do
They know they left its lies

Seeing everything go
End of all things
The life, that we know
Shift your point of view
You’ve been warned
This one way ticket is for you
