It’s not so much the pain
It’s more the actual knife
Pretending the picture is perfect
I cut myself to sleep
I close my eyes for a second
And meet the fragile soul
I scream to hide that I’m lonely
The echo calls my name

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You’re there for me

Take this life, I’m right here
Stay a while and breathe me in
Take this life, I’m right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

The raindrops just beg to hit me
What now? Hasn’t rained for days
No time to play hide-and-seek
I call on you to take me on

Break me down to pieces
Put me back, do it right this time
Struggling to fill this empty shell
Burn my efforts
In the end, it means nothing

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You’re there for me

Take this life, I’m right here
Stay a while and breathe me in
Take this life, I’m right here
Stay a while and breathe me in

These thoughts
Burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts
Will keep me feeling

These thoughts
Burn a hole in my heart
These thoughts
Will keep me feeling

If I ever, if I never
Make me understand the thought, whatever
Make me see, make me be
Make me understand
You’re there for me

Take this life, I’m right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
Take this life, I’m right here
Stay awhile and breathe me in
