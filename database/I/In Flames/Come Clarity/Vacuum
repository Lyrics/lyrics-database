The yesterday we loved
Speak of tomorrow
The burden of man is that
Time never takes a pause
We live from Monday to Sunday
But we forget what it means
Then a ghost comes to visit and
We tell stories from tabloids

Call all your friends
Watch fake photos
From a made up vacations
Speaking in tongues
About ancient artefacts

We steal from beggars
And ask for understanding
Lie, rape, steal and murder
To make tonight’s headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get
The stronger they become

Listen in silence
Hear her voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence
Hear her voice
Before it all crumbles

Lie, rape, steal and murder
Smile, applaud, love, hail

Gather in front of the TV
Exploding sympathy
The weatherman, our trust
Our punctual company

We steal from beggars
And ask for understanding
Lie, rape, steal and murder
To make tonight’s headlines

Trust the system
Make your contribution
Smile, applaud, love, hail
The weaker you get the
Stronger they become

Listen in silence
Hear her voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence
Hear her voice
Before it all crumbles

Lie, rape, steal and murder
Smile, applaud, love, hail

Listen in silence
Hear her voice
How far are we ready to take this?
Listen in silence
Hear her voice
Before it all crumbles
