Leeches
Like leeches
In ignorance we trust

If you say this way
I will take that way
Fuel for the fire
Which I thrive

Spit me out
I’m glad I don’t belong
Save me the speech
You’ll be forgotten and gone

It burns
It rips, it hurts

Leeches
They preach to us
Words of wisdom
From blocked minds

Spit me out
When I don’t belong
Save me the beat
You’ll be forgotten and gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts
They make you bleed your turn
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive?

A tear for the poet
That can’t be heard
Praise the artist
That steals

Spit me out
I’m glad I don’t belong
Save me the speech
You’ll be forgotten, gone

It burns, it rips, it hurts
They make you bleed your turn
(It hurts)
The chance of a lifetime
How does it feel to be alive?
