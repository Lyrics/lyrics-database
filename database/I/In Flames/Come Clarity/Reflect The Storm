Shot for shot
Let the bullets penetrate me
Embrace me
Tell me stories of golden gods
The precision in your voice
Pierce the walls that I’ve built
Your eyes reach deep in me

Take a chance
They don’t come
Much bigger than this
A Dark Star
Spend another day with me
A dead surface
That doesn’t reflect
The storm underneath
Take a chance
Bring me the calm

When there’s nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

Throw yourself
Into the eye of chaos
Infiltrate me
Sneak out before I awake
Take out the trash
And burn it
Try to find a beautiful
Place to lay
These fragile bones of mine

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me

When there’s nothing
Expose the dark side
Aching and emotional
Expose the dark side
Impossible to tame

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really

Away from the light of the sun
Away I find what is really me
