Compassion, confession
Resolve and compromise
Dedication, domination
Please define the lines

Mutation innovation
Paired-up to succeed
Retaliation termination
Six lives and greed

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I’m trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma

Agression, attention
A need to be seen
Gyrated disrespected
Stand in line
To be centre of scene

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I’m trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma

Surrender to nothing
Or run as far as you can
I’m trying to hold on
To what I believe in
But my heart, is in a coma
