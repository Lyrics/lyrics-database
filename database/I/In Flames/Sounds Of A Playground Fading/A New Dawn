I dreamed that you’ve died
I’m forever alone
I’m weak and I’m frightened
This brings about a change
Thing you said to me
Believe and things you might find
Will turn into a march

I stand along and breath again
I won’t stop until this is through

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

Feel a sudden haze
Time to get moving
Getting somewhere with no directions
I swear to you
It will never be the same
It’s not straight but the road lies open
Leaving all tears behind

I stand along and breath again
I won’t stop until this is through

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me

Erase darkness from from my mind
Last remaining night
From here to everywhere

I stand along and breath again
I won’t stop until this is through

And I can’t wait to see the sun rise again
It’s moments like this
I’m what you’ll never be
To better what I am
You won’t hear lies from me
