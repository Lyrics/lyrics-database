I say goodbye to you all at once
Don’t dare to face you all alone
I went from wreckage to world class
With a box of T-shirts and some records to sell
But times have changed
I have to defend my actions
The foundation crumbles and I have to leave
Thanks for everything
I couldn’t ask for more
I say "I love you all" as I vanish through the Jester’s door
