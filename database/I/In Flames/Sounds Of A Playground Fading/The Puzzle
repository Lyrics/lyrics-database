And I tried to think
Tried to paint the picture
I lived it all
Wouldn’t have to feel this way

(Looking for something to believe in)
Looking for something to believe in
I think I’ve done my time
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

Keep pretending
I can handle everything
You’ll never understand me
And I don’t care what you think
Or maybe I do?

(One by one the pieces fall)
One by one the pieces fall
Tell me what it is to believe

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light
Grab a piece of the light

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light

You can tell days by their faces
There are always signs
Answers to the puzzle
Grab a piece of the light
