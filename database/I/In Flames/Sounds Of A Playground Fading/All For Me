Until the world ceases to move
That burning feeling
Let me go
This is real
Always one more thing
I clench my hands and bang my head

Take whatever comes to you
All the while,
I don’t need another friend

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It’s all for me now
I’m sure that one day
I can get you all that you lost

I never told
Blessed is the sick in me
I’m dying alone
We stand to fight for nothing
Without a thought, a reason
It will never be okay

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It’s all for me now
I’m sure that one day
I can get you all you lost

A growing pain
It’s hard to say what brought the darkest burden
For some of us there’s no answer

Chains are breaking
I won’t let this build up inside me
There’s a storm coming
But I’ll serve no more
’Till my very last breath

I burn when I do the things I do for you
Forever the night
It’s all for me now
I’m sure that one day
I can get you all you lost
