Twisting tongue
Fallen off the edge again
Need some space
Need disgrace
I’m confused I’m in a maze

I need for you to pick me up
When I fall down
There’s so much more
We can go far
But I can’t control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

Who’s the man in front of me?
(Who’s the man in front of me?)
I’m blindfolded, I can’t see
Need a reason, I’m left empty

There’s so much more
We can go far
But I can’t control my selfish ways

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you

This inner apathy  brings me to life
I know it’s strange and it’s draining me
I’m tired
I’m fed up
I’m a slave

I’m tired
I’m fed up
I’m a slave

Enter tragedy
Slash my soul
Why is it part of the plan?
Do you question me?
I question you
