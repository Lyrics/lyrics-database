Without the sense of space or time
The infinite
The endless static
The doubt. We never had a way

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I’m going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Tormented minds they wander
Drifting away from the light
I will lift you up my friend
You have to learn to breathe again

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I’m going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers

Unlock the secrets
Let us find the memories
Find ourselves some ruins
Turn them into something

You are lost within
Fading out
A world that threw you away

Let us play a game
If you take my hand
I’m going to get you out of here
Away from the monsters in the ballroom
And the swinging chandeliers
