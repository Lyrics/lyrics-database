Throw it all away
Until we are erased
But it doesn’t mean a thing

And I can’t remember
What the skies looked like
Will I find out
That I’m late for salvation?

What if tomorrow never comes?
Don’t let it slip away

This is my world now
I can’t let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

Gravity takes control
Don’t forsake my troubled times
I’m starting to regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don’t let it slip away

This is my world now
I can’t let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again

I will be reborn

I’m gonna take the world on
Someday I will
I’m gonna take the world on
Someday I will

Throw it all away
Afraid I will drift on the open sea
I regret not telling you
All the things I should have

Roll the dice just one more time
Don’t let it slip away

This is my world now
I can’t let you bring me down
This new faith guide me through
Things will come my way
Put it down and join the lie
Dead eyes will see again
