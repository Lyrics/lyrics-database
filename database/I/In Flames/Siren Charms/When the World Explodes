I’m right here
When the world explodes
Try to remember these words
When the world explodes!

In the darkest of nights
You are my endless fire inside
Across the waters and back to shore
Through space in time, you guide me

Afraid there’s not much time
Life’s a matter of moments
Face the truth
That I cannot run
I always known

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know, dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me

Face the truth, that I cannot run
I always known (I always known)

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know, dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me (lay with me)

So if I never get to say this to you
You should still know
Dry your eyes… dry your eyes
Find a stream that leads toward the water of the divine
Come lay with me
