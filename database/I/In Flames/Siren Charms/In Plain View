The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There’s nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again… I don’t know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I’ve been hopelessly lost in the fear

Are we the only ones?
It’s all dark in here
Do I just waste my time?
Searching for exits in infinite space

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I’ve been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

All the lights
All the lights
Is that the future or another lullaby?

The fire
My heads all wired
In plain view
There’s nothing in the way
I see with clarity
The eye of destiny
But just a little spark and once again… I don’t know

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I’ve been hopelessly lost in the fear
Are you for real?

Deep inside
The memories that are left behind
Close my eyes
I’ve been hopelessly lost in the fear
