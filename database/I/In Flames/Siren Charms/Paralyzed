Vultures descend
Feeding on us
There’s no sympathy

Breeding the hate

Turn away
Run away
From all the things we have to do

And it tears away our hearts and our soul

It’s like we’re on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
Rewind
There’s no time
The wasteland… It’s an indication

Out of excuses
Will we understand?

That we’re on our own
To figure out
Cast out
Paralyzed
This time
We have found the wasteland
