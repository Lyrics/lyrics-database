Gotta get you alone
Gotta get you alone
Gotta get you all on your own
Gotta get you alone

Wanna give you my love
Wanna give you my love
'Cause all this talk is not enough
I wanna give you my love

Wanna have my wicked way with you
With no one else in view
Oh, this fire in my heart so hot
That it’s burnin’, burnin’ through
Is this sent from Heaven, Hell
Or a potion of the two?
All I know is it’s torture
I’m your pin doll, you’re my voodoo

Wanna kiss your mouth
Wanna kiss your mouth
Oh, I’ve been watching how you pout
Wanna taste that mouth

And let me slip away
Let me slip away
Let me slip away, not a word to say
Just let me slip away

Wanna have my wicked way with you
With no one else in view
Oh, this fire in my heart, so hot
That it’s burnin’, burnin’ through
Is this sent from Heaven, Hell
Or a potion of the two?
All I know is it’s torture
I’m your pin doll, you’re my voodoo

Ye, all I know is it’s torture
I’m your pin doll, you’re my voodoo

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
