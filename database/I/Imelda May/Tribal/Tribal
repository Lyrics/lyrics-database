(One, two, one-two-three)

We all got our marks to what or who we belong
Apart we are weak but together we’re strong
Don’t knock one of us or we all take offence
For a quiff or a crew we can jump to defence

With the drums that you bring
Or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh

Fashion is something that comes and goes
Fickle as fables of emperors clothes
What you put on tells a lot of your mind
If you’re part of a pack or one of a kind

With the drums that you bring
Or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh

Standing in a crowd, I hold my head up proud
What’s right for you, for me it may be wrong
It’s great to be different
But have something to belong

When you look in the mirror, tell me what do you see
Someone new or your ancestry?
You’re a king, you’re a queen, you’re a wizard, a fool
Or if you’re me, then rockabilly rules

With the drums that you bring
Or the song that you sing
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
Tribal, oh-oh-oh-oh
