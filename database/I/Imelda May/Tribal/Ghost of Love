I can’t survive another night
I’m lost again, and can’t get to the light
And the bottle is as empty as my mind
And the truth I search is getting hard to find

I waste my love for just a while
And now I find my life is on trial
There’s not much time left for me to wait
And a courtroom full of ghosts decide my faith, ah

Judge me once, but don’t judge me twice
Listen, let me give you some advice
Just save your soul, and I pray for mine
To the ghost of love and the ghost of time

In an awful lot of fear, a lot of hate
I must control before I held my faith
The prosecution want my soul to burn
And the judge will let me know when it’s the turn, ah

Judge me once, but don’t judge me twice
Listen, let me give you some advice
Just save your soul, and I pray for mine
To the ghost of love and the ghost of time

Suddenly, a light shines in my face
And the boggle in my head feels out of place
A ghostly voice is fading from my mind
And it’s telling me, my life I’ve yet to find, ah

Judge me once, but don’t judge me twice
Listen, let me give you some advice
Just save your soul, and I pray for mine
To the ghost of love and the ghost of time

To the ghost of love and the ghost of time
To the ghost of love and the ghost of time
