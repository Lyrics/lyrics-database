Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do
Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do
Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do
Do…

My thoughts are dark and empty, I’m now cryin’ out loud
Don’t know what am I askin’ for, or if an answer can be found
The loneliness is killin’, though there’s someone in my bed
There’s only so much living and I fear I could be dead
But then standin’ at my window when the night seems like it’s won
And everythin’ seems brighter with the sightin’ of the sun

And I said, oh my god, it’s good to be alive
Oh my god, it’s good to be alive
I know one thing for sure’s that I’ll die
But today, yeah, it’s good to be alive

(Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do)
(Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do)

Lyin’ in my bedroom, my eyes are wide awake
My body’s tired and givin’ up, oh for heaven’s sake
Won’t you please send me a little sleep, to ease my worried mind
I’m losin’ rationality, that I won’t know how to find
But then standin’ at my window when the night seems like it’s won
And everythin’ seems brighter with the sightin’ of the sun

And I said, oh my god, it’s good to be alive
Oh my god, it’s good to be alive
I know one thing for sure’s that I’ll die
But today, yeah, it’s good to be alive, yea

Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do
Do-do-do, mm-do, mm-do-do

Things are lookin’ up for me, when the clock keeps tickin’ on
Holdin’ onto time gone by, clingin’ to a song
To pull me through with every word, and rock me with a tune
To hold my hand when the shadow man is hidin’ in my room
But then standin’ at my window when the night seems like it’s won
And everythin’ seems brighter with the sightin’ of the sun

And I said, oh my god, it’s good to be alive
Oh my god, it’s good to be alive
I know one thing for sure’s that I’ll die
But today, yeah, it’s good to be alive

Oh my god, it’s good to be alive
Oh my god, it’s good to be alive
I know one thing for sure’s that I’ll die
But today, yeah, it’s good to be alive

Do-do-do
It’s good to be alive
Do-do-do
It’s good to be alive

Yeah-yea-ye
Ye-ye-yea
