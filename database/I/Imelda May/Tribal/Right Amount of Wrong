I like a little bit of bad
In a good-good man
A little bit of mad
Can be a whole lotta fun

When you get mean babe, you’re second to none
Outta seven billion beings, you are my one

You got me good, yeah you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

You have the edge on a world that’s round
You are lost but don’t wanna be found
You stand alone when you’re in a crowd
You don’t dream but you scream out loud

You got me good, yeah you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

A pinch of salt goes good with sweet
A hint of pain is great with a treat
Just like a cute dog baring it’s teeth
I love a little strange and I dig a bit of a freak

Yeah, you got me good, you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

Your bad is good
And good you’re not
Yea, your wicked is great
Ooh, and your cool is hot

Yeah, you got me good, you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

Yeah, you got me good, got me all the way
This girl could fall, could be led astray
Your kiss is soft but not too weak
You keep me on my toes then you sweep me off my feet

Yeah, you got me good, you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

I said, you got me good, you got it goin’ on
You do it for me, you’re the right amount of wrong

Oh-oh-oh!
