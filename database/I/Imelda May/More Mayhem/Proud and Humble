I said, “Lord, here’s the total of what I done
Sometimes I did good, sometimes I done wrong
But I did the best I could from where I come from
And I keep on trying ’til my day is done”

So, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
Yea, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
I’ll be proud and humble, humble and proud
When I come, yeah, when I’m done, yea-yea-ye

Oh, I made the most from what I knew then
But if I lived it over I’d do the same again
I try, I try for You, to please
But You know I’m only human, You created me

And so, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
Yea, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
I’ll be proud and humble, humble and proud
When I come, yeah, when I’m done, yea-yea-ye, ye-ye

Oh, yea-ye-ye!

Oo-ooo-ooh
Oo-ooo-ooh, yeah
Mmm-hmm-hmm
Mmm-hmm

Well, I’m humbled by You and thankful, oh Lord
I studied Your life and Your holy word
But I hold my head just a little high
’Cause I’m proud that I got on with this given life

And so, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
Yea, I’m proud and humble, humble and proud
I’ll be proud and humble, humble and proud
When I come, yeah, when I’m done, ye-yea

Oh-oh, I’m prould and humble, humble and proud
Proud and humble, humble and proud, oh yeah

Prould and humble, humble and proud
When I come, yea, When I’m done, yea-yea-yea-ye-ye-yea-yeah
When I’ll come here
Said when I’m done, yea

Lord, I’ll be coming, yea-ye
Oh, I’ll be coming, ye-ye-yea-yeah-ye

When I’ll be coming
Said when I’m done, yea
When I’ll come here
Said when I’m done, yea-yeah-yeah-yea-ye
