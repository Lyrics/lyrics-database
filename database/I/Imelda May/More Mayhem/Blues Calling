I try to keep smiling, have on my happy face
Got a new job, joined the human race
Have me a home, and a family too
No complaints, no big issues

But the blues keeps on callin’
No matter where I roam
And the blues keeps on crawlin’
Follow me ’round, yeah, draggin’ me down

Got me a man, got on with my life
I’m gonna make it no trouble, no strife
Get through the day with my head above ground
Keep grinding on, look, I’m happiness bound

But the blues keeps on callin’
No matter where I roam
And the blues keeps on crawlin’
Follow me ’round, yeah, draggin’ me down

They won’t stop nagging those sweet memories
Of times gone by, when I was truly happy
I’m struggling on, keep trudging along
Can’t fight it no more, but I got to be strong
And keep up this pretence, let nobody down!

But the blues keeps on callin’
No matter where I roam
And the blues keeps on crawlin’
Follow me ’round, yeah, oh-oh, draggin’ me down

Follow me around, yea
Dragging me…

Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
