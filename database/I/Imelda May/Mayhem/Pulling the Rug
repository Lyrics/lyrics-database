Hey!

Good life came calling
I fell under its spell and kept falling
Yea-ye, great night, so fitting
I sat into your lap and stayed sitting

Oh-oh, your smile seemed willing
You hid behind your porcelain filling
Oh-oh, big lights, so pretty
Got swept away by lies, it’s a pity

Ooh-ooh-ye
Oh-oh-ye
Ooh-ooh-ye

I’ll write you a story
But knowing you, you’ll take all the glory
Oh-oh, fat cats got lazy
The truth behind the cream, it got hazy

So now you’re pulling the rug from under me
Putting a gun in front of me
Pulling the rug from under me
Ye-yes, you’re pulling the rug from under me
Putting a gun in front of me
Pulling the rug from under me

But I won’t let you get me down
Gonna spin you upside down
’Til you don’t know
Your head from you tail

I got a way, I got a will
God, I’m never standing still
Long enough for you
To pin a win or fail

Oh, pulling the rug, yeah!

Time is ticking by
My life is flying high
But you, you-you, you and I
Have ended our days of dreaming

Pulling the rug from under me
Putting a gun in front of me
Pulling the rug from under me
Ye-yes, you’re pulling the rug from under me
Putting a gun in front of me
Pulling the rug from under me

But I won’t let you get me down
Gonna spin you upside down
’Til you don’t know
Your head from you tail

I got a way, I got a will
God, I’m never standin’ still
Long enough for you
To pin a win or fail

Oh, pulling the rug, yeah (pulling the rug)
Putting a gun, yeah (putting a gun)
Pulling the rug… (pulling the rug)
Yea-yeah, ye-yeah (putting a gun)

Pulling the rug from under me (pulling the rug)
Putting a gun in front of me (putting a gun)
Pulling the rug from under me (pulling the rug)
Ye-yea (putting the gun)

Dup-dup-dup, dup-du-dup (pulling the rug)
Dup-dup-dup, dup-du-dup (putting a gun)
Dup-dup-dup, dup-du-dup (pulling the rug)
Dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup (putting a gun)

Dup-dup-dup, dup-du-dup-dup
Dup-dup-dup, pu-dup-du-dup-dup
Pa-dup-pa-dup
Pa-dup-pa-dup, dup-dup
