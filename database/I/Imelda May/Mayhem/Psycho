Keep on talkin’ you medication
Lock that temper behind those pills
Your brain is flyin’, insanely fryin’
Just remember, it’s bad to kill

I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho

No more growlin’, stop you prowlin’
Leave those cars and people alone
You’re an animal, a human cannibal
Snarlin’ and snappin’ like a dog on a bone

I go with a psycho
Yeah, I go with a psycho

You terrify my neighbours when you scream and shout
You look like it’s contagious, you’re foaming at the mouth
You’re a freakin’ nightmare when you’re lyin’ in my bed
You sleep with eyes wide open like the living dead

I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho

Oh, oh, oh

You terrify my neighbours when you scream and shout
You look like it’s contagious, you’re foaming at the mouth
You’re a freakin’ nightmare when you’re lyin’ in my bed
You sleep with eyes wide open like the living dead

I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho

I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho
I go with a psycho
