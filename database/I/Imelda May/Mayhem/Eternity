Since I met you baby
I feel that you somehow saved me
Your smile lets me know
That your heart warmly glows

It took forever to find eternity
It took forever to find eternity

Time flew by me
Now I understand, you see
Time played a waiting game
It seems you felt the same, oh

It took forever to find eternity, yeah-yea-yea-yea
It took forever to find eternity

When love passes by
No one really understands why
But time will help you see
Another way, it’s not too late to find eternity

Our love is now set free
The waiting game was the key
And when I see you standing there
Everything now seems fair

It took forever to find eternity, yeah-yea-yea-yea
It took forever to find eternity

Ooh!

When love passes by
No one really understands why
But time will help you see
Another way, it’s not too late to find eternity

Our love is now set free
The waiting game was the key
And when I see you standing there
Everything now seems fair

It took forever to find eternity, yeah-yea-yea-yea
It took forever to find eternity, hmm-mm
It took forever
It took forever
It took forever to find eternity
