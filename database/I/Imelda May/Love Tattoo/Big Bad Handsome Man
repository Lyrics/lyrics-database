The man is tall, mad, mean and good lookin’
And he’s got me in his eye
When he looks at me, I go weak at the knees
Got me going like no other guy

’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man, yeah
He’s got me in the palm of his hand
He’s the devil divine, I’m so glad that he’s mine
’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man

Oh, the music he plays, the way he moves me and sways
Rocks me to the core
When he sings in my ear, he makes me shiver and leer
Leaves me wanting more and more

’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man, yeah
He’s got me in the palm of his hand
He’s the devil divine, I’m so glad that he’s mine
’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man

With his rugged good looks, yeah, he’s got me hooked
Got me where he wants me to be
With his arms so wide, he pulls me in by his side
He’s the kinda guy that does it for me

’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man, yeah
He’s got me in the palm of his hand
He’s the devil divine, I’m so glad that he’s mine
’Cause he’s my big bad handsome man

Oh, my big bad handsome man, yeah
He’s got me in the palm of his hand
He’s the devil divine, I’m so glad that he’s mine
’Cause he’s my big bad…
I’m so glad that he’s my big bad handsome man, yeah
