I’m a little girl, I’m a teenie weenie
But a big piece of fun for only five foot three
All the girls at the front, yea, towering over me
So I waved and I jumped, but you couldn’t see

I said, “You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
Y’hoo-hoo, you are looking for me?”

So I put on my high heels, the highest I could
Four more inches is always good
But still too low for a midget like me
So I waved and I jumped, but you still couldn’t see

I said, “You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
Y’hoo-hoo, you are looking for me?”

So I climbed on a chair to get a better view
But I still couldn’t see anything of you
You looked straight ahead, right over me
So I waved down and I jumped, but you still couldn’t see

I said, “You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
You… Y’hoo!
Y’hoo, you are looking for me?”

I said, “Y’hoo-hoo, you are looking for me?”

“Y’hoo-hoo, you are looking for me?”
