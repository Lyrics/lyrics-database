Woke up this mornin’ ’bout a quarter to six
Found myself in a terrible fix!
My babe was gone, and my Cadillac too
Now, won’t you tell me what I gotta do?

Well, I’m lookin’ high and I’m lookin’ low
Where in the world did that man of mine go?
I gotta find my baby and bring him back
’Cause he ran off with my Cadillac

He said he loved me, said he always would
But then he took off just like Robin Hood
He had a dark green suit and a feather in a hat
He wasn’t nothin’ but a real cool cat

I’m lookin’ high and I’m lookin’ low
Where in the world did that man of mine go?
I gotta find my baby and bring him back
’Cause he ran off with my Cadillac, yeah-yea

I really thought, it was true to me
But then he left me full of misery
I really need him, and I want him back
But if I had my choice, I’d take the Cadillac

I’m lookin’ high and I’m lookin’ low
Where in the world did that man of mine go?
I gotta find my baby and bring him back
’Cause he ran off with my Cadillac, yea

Bring my Cadillac back, oh baby
Bring my Cadillac back, yeah
Bring my Cadillac back, c’mon baby!
Bring my Cadillac back

Oh, baby, bring my Cadillac back!
Oooh-oh-oh-oh
Bring it back boy, bring it back
I so want my Cadillac back

Oooh-ooh
