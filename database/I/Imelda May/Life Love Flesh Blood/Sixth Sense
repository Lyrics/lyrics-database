Getting one kiss closer to kill
My resistance to your kind of thrill
Lend me your lips
Let me know that you’re real

Can’t commit this crime, can’t ignore
You got my love-stained heart on the floor
So I surrender
Can’t take it no more

I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I pretend not to wanna, but it’s haunting me at night and day, yeah
I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I’m damned if I show it, but I can’t shake this feeling away
Just can’t shake it away

When you touch me, rub-a-dub-dub
You got my mind in the gutter of love
Down on my knees, I can’t get enough

I swear, I saw you once in a dream
Jumped out a window, we kissed in the sea
And we were good
In my fantasy

I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I pretend not to wanna, but it’s hauntin’ me at night and day, yeah
I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I’m damned if I show it but I can’t shake this feeling away
Just can’t shake it away

I see it in the stars
I feel it in my bones
It’s written in the cards
Just like we’ve always known

I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I pretend not to wanna, but it’s haunting me at night and day, yeah

I got a sixth sense, baby ’bout you and me
I’m damned if I show it but I can’t shake this feeling away
Just can’t shake it away
