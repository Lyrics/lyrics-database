My heart is thumpin’ inside of my chest
My temple is burnin’ and is drippin’ with sweat
My mind is spinnin’ yeah swimmin’ around
My tongues dried up like I’ve been lickin’ the ground

It’s the longing
The longing for you
It’s the longing…

The hole in my chest, it twists like a knife
Takin’ over my body, takin’ over my life
I can’t think of nothin’, no one else gonna do
I’m haunted by the living, yea, wantin’ you

It’s the longing
The longing for you
It’s the longing
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you

Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you

The moon can move the ocean
Could it get me to you?
I got myself the notion
That you long for me too
Gonna drag every limb of my body to sea
If just one wave can push me closer to thee

It’s the longing
The longing for you
It’s the longing
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you, yeah

My tongue’s dried up and it’s hangin’ down, yeah
Pacin’ the floor, like I’m a dog on the prowl, yeah
Lookin’ at the moon, and I wanted to howl, yeah
Under your spell, want to be under you now

It’s the longing!
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you
It’s the longing!
The longing for you
It’s the longing

Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you

Ohh, ohh
Ohh

Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
Gotta, gotta get to you
Gotta get to you
