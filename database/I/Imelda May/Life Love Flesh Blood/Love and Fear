A man stood before me
Bowed his head and he prayed
Words from the heart
A moment of grace

He spoke soft and clearly
Of only two things
Both primal emotions
Of commoners and kings

He said, good people do bad things
Bad people do good
If the choice is between love and fear
I choose love, yea
Ooh, I choose love

(Tu-tu-tu-tudu-tu-tu-tu)
(Tu-tu-tu-tudu-tu-tu-tu)

The devil has his Bible
The preacher has his horns
Even angels fall
Every rose has its thorns

Like fire and water
Together can’t exist
One kills the other
Judas with a kiss

Oh, good people do bad things
Bad people do good
If the choice is between love and fear
I choose love, yeah
Ooo-oh, I choose love

I choose love
Oh, love, yeah love
Ooooo, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

The man who beats his woman
Then says, "For you I’d die"
He’s afraid she’s leaving
She’s afraid to try

Oh, love is patient
You see, love is kind
But if hidden by fear, yea-ye
Then it’s hard to find

Ooh, good people do bad things
Bad people do good
But the choice is between love and fear
I choose love, yeah

Oh-oh-oh, good people do bad things, yeah
Oh-oh, bad people do good
But the choice is between love and fear
I choose love, oh
I choose love, yeah
I choose love

Love, love, love, love, oh love
Ooh, love, love, love
