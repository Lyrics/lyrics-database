We gonna run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home

We gonna run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home

We gonna run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home

We gonna run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home

I found myself going away
Never wanting to go back again.
Leaving all my thoughts behind
Searching for some new ones inside.

I found myself
I found myself
I found myself
I found myself
I found myself
I found myself
I found myself
I found myself

Run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home.

Run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home.

We gonna run run run
To the cities of the future
Take what we can and bring it back home
So take me down to the cities of the future
Everybody’s happy and i feel at home.
