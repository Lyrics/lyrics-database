Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend
Keep you in the dark and so it all began

Send in your skeletons
Sing as their bones come marching in again
The need you buried deep
The secrets that you keep are at the ready, are you ready?

I’m finished making sense
Done pleading ignorance that whole defense
Spinning infinity, but the wheel is spinning me
It’s never ending, never ending
Same old story

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

In time or so I’m told
I’m just another soul for sale, oh well
The page is out of print
We are not permanent, we’re temporary, temporary
Same old story

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

I’m the voice inside your head, you refuse to hear
I’m the face that you have to face, mirrored in your stare
I’m what’s left, I’m what’s right, I’m the enemy
I’m the hand that’ll take you down, bring you to your knees

So, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?
Yeah, who are you?

Keep you in the dark you know they all pretend

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

What if I say I’m not like the others
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
You’re the pretender
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

What if I say I’m not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
(You know they all)
You’re the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

What if I say I’m not like the others?
(Keep you in the dark)
What if I say I’m not just another one of your plays
(You know they all)
You’re the pretender
(Pretend)
What if I say that I’ll never surrender

So who are you
Yeah who are you
Yeah who are you!
