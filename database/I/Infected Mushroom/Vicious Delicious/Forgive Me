Can you tell me a story that I don’t know
Can you show me a picture that I haven’t seen before
Can you do one thing for me
Just let me go

Can you tell me a story that I don’t know
Can you show me a picture that I haven’t seen before
Can you do one thing for me
Just let me go
Just let me go
Just let me go

Can you give me a reason why to stay behind
Can you say to my face that I’m not wasting all my time
Can you do one thing for me
Just let me go

Can you see the way I’m happy and the story that is ending
And my final place to be, with some quiet endlessly
Can you show me one more time
Just where to go

Forgive me, for leaving you alone
Forgive me, for not staying any more
Forgive me, for leaving you alone
Forgive me, for not waiting any more
Forgive me, for leaving you alone
Forgive me, for not waiting any more
