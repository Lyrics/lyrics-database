Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime
That’s why I always poop on company time
And these fancy toilets are sublime
Gonna take my sweet time

Strolling to the john at half past nine
Coming back whenever I’m feeling fine
Dropping a deuce, scrolling a phone
I ain’t in no rush to get back to the grind

They say time is money, so I’m getting paid
To remedy my morning coffee crimes
Boss ain’t telling no, my work ethic has decayed
Well, I’m doing my business on company time!

Constipation’s a valid excuse
To dodge my duties, I’ll play it loose
My work act output stuck in a jam
But my colon’s happy as a clam!

Boss makes a dollar, I make a dime
That’s why I always poop on company time
Those fancy toilets are sublime
Yea, gonna take my sweet time
