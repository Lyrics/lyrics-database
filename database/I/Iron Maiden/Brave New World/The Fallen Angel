Azazel is besides you and he’s playing a game
Demons are inside you and they are making a play
Watching and their hiding as they wait for the time
For a devil to get ready to take over your mind

You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the only one
You and only God will know what can be done
You and only God will know I am the chosen one

Could it be it’s the end of our world
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
’Cause I am the chosen one

Beaten fallen angel but I’ve risen again
And the power is inside me I’ve decided to pray
As I wait for Armageddon and he’s coming my way
It’s an honor to be chosen and i wait for the day

Could it be it’s the end of our world
All the things that we cherish and love
Nothing left but to face this all of my own
’Cause I am the chosen one
