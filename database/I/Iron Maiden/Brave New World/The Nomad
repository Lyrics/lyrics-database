Like a mirage riding on the desert sand
Like a vision floating with the desert winds
Know the secret of the ancient desert lands
you’re the keeper of the mystery in your hands

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

Undercover of the veil of your disguise
The men that fear you are the ones that you despise
No one’s certain what your future will behold
You’re a legend your own story will be told

Nomad, rider of the ancient east
Nomad, rider that men know the least
Nomad, where you come from no one knows
Nomad, where you go to no one tells

No one dares to even look or glance your way
Your reputation goes before you they all say
Like a spirit that can disappear at will
Many claim of things but no one’s seen you kill

Nomad, you’re the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you’re the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you’re the rider of the desert sands
No man’s ever understood your genius

Those who see you in horizon desert sun
Those who fear your reputation hide or run
You send before you a mystique that’s all your own
Your silhouette is like a statue carved in stone

Nomad, you’re the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you’re the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you’re the rider of the desert sands
No man’s ever understood your genius

Legend has it that you speak an ancient tongue
But no one’s spoke to you and lived to tell the tale
Some they say that you have killed a hundred man
Others say that you have died and live again

Nomad, you’re the rider so mysterious
Nomad, you’re the spirit that men fear in us
Nomad, you’re the rider of the desert sands
No man’s ever understood your genius
