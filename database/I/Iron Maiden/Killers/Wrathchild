I was born into a scene of angriness and greed, and dominance and persecution.
My mother was a queen, my dad I’ve never seen, I was never meant to be.

Now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man that’s nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I’m never gonna stop searching,
I’m gonna find my man, gonna travel around.

’Cause I’m a wrathchild, well I’m a wrathchild.
Yeah I’m a wrathchild. I’m coming to get you, oh yeah.

Oh yeah

Say it doesn’t matter ain’t nothin’ gonna alter the course of my destination.
I know I’ve got to find some serious piece of mind, or I know I’ll go crazy.

But now I spend my time looking all around,
For a man thats nowhere to be found.
Until I find him I’m never gonna stop searching,
I’m gonna find my man, gonna travel around.

’Cause I’m a wrathchild, well I’m a wrathchild.
Yeah I’m a wrathchild. I’m coming to get you, oh yeah.
