As I lay here lying on my bed
Sweet voices come into my head.
Oh what it is, I want to know
Please won’t you tell me it’s got to go.
There’s a feeling that’s inside me
Telling me to get away.
But I’m so tired of living
I might as well end today.

As I lay here lying on my bed

There’s a feeling that’s inside me
Telling me to get away.
But I’m so tired of living
I might as well end today.
