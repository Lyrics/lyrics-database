My life is so empty, nothing to live for.
My mind is all confusion, ’cos I defied the law.
When you weren’t there to help me, I lost my mind and ran.
I never had no trouble before this all began.

I never had no trouble before this all began.

I’m running away, no where to go.
I’m lost and tired and I just don’t know. Yeah…
They say I killed a woman, they know it isn’t true.
They’re just trying to frame me, and all because of you. Yeah…
