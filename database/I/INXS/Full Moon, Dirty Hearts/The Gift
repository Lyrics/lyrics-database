Oh so fine
We were trying
Out of nowhere
Just in time
Let you take me
Deep down the river
Kiss the changes
That shape my life

Always
Left behind
All the tracks that
I could find

Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what’s mine
Here we lie
Looking up to
Empty sky
And the promises we find

I’m not the first one
To ask why

Yeah-yeah

Do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do
All we ever try

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

(Let you take me
Deep down the river
Kiss the changes
That shape my life)


Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
(Yeah)

Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
(All these scars are mine)
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
All these scars are mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what’s mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what’s mine

I was thinking
Got the feeling
The gift you gave
Is gonna last forever

All the lies you find
All the truth you see
Rise and fall
But I know what’s mine
