On the talk back show
On the radio
At the local bar
In the hot traffic by the red tail lights

Everybody’s down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it’s all in your hands?

And we take it down
To the end of town
Where they have control
But they’re losing touch when the lights go out

Everybody’s down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it’s all in your hands?

Everybody’s down on their knees
Listen like thieves for the answers
But who needs that
When you got it all in your hands?
It’s all in your hands
It’s all in your hands!

(You are all you need)
You are all you need
And that is everything
So don’t hesitate
There’s no time to waste
You just, just do it for yourself

I said, everybody’s down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it’s all in your hands?

You got it all
You got it all
It’s all in your hands
You got it all, you got it all

I said everybody’s down on their knees
Listen like thieves
But who needs that
When it’s all in your hands?
