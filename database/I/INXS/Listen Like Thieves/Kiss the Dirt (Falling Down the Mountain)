Playing in the dirt
We find the seeds of doubt
Don’t water them with your tears
Don’t think about all the years
You’d rather be without

Eden lets me in
I find the seeds of love
And climb upon the highwire
I kiss and tell all my fears

Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn’t hurt

Playing in the dirt
We find the seeds of fun
And we scream like alleycats
Tearing down what we attack
To prove that we are one

Cutting through the night
We find the seeds of lust
And lose our minds on one intent
These passions never seem to end

Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn’t hurt

You know it wouldn’t hurt

Hey!

Falling down the mountain
End up getting hurt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn’t hurt, yea

Get up, get up, get up, get up
To the top, yeah

I’m falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt, yeah
I’m falling, falling

Yeah-yeah-yeah!

Cutting through the night
We find the seeds of lust
And lose our minds on one intent
These passions never seem to end

Falling down the mountain
End up kissing dirt
Look a little closer
Sometimes it wouldn’t hurt
