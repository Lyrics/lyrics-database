Don’t you know what you’re doing?
You’ve got a death wish!

Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde
Suicide blonde

Suicide blonde was the color of her hair
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair
She knew it would finish before it began
Wow baby, I think you lost the plan

You want to make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You want to make her suicide blonde
Love temptation, suicide blonde

She stripped to the beat, but her clothes stayed on
White light everywhere, but you can’t see a thing
Such a squeeze, a mad sad moment
Glory to you, glory to you, take me there… take me there

Got some revelation, put it into your hands
Save you from your misery like rain across the land
Don’t you see the color of deception?
Turning your world around again

You want to make her, suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You want to make her suicide blonde
Love temptation, suicide blonde

You want to make…
You want to make…
You want to make her suicide blonde
You want to make

That’s the story
Everything you want to be
Everything you are
Are

You want to make her suicide blonde
Love devastation, suicide blonde
You want to make her suicide blonde
Love temptation, suicide blonde

Love devastation
You want to make her suicide blonde
Love temptation, suicide blonde
You want to make her…
