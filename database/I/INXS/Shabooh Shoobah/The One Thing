Well you know just what you do to me
The way you move soft and slippery
Cut the night just like a razor
Rarely talk and that’s the danger

It’s the one thing
You are my thing

You know your voice is a love song
It’s a cat call from the past
There’s no ice in your lovers walk
You don’t look twice ’cause you move so fast

It’s the one thing
You are my thing

You’ve got a dozen men behind you
You’ve got dead flowers on the floor
You’re too pretty in the daylight
It keeps them coming back for more

It’s the one thing
You are my thing

It’s the one thing
You are my thing

It’s the one thing
You are my thing
