Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I vow to play the part

In this a meeting of the soul
My feelings are unknown
I learn with no regret
I’m getting what I get

Feel some pain though I’m miles away
And ring to let you know
Are you seeing someone?
I’d better let you go

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Honesty eludes one and all
Like some gypsy’s search for gold
He’s dreaming all the time
But the gold is hard to find

Promises are carved out of lust
With a fire in the heart
That burns with no regret
I’m getting what I get

Made a mistake with myself
My lover couldn’t lie
She told me of the things
That made her cry inside

She said this was a lesson in love
She said this was a love to end all loves
This soul never listens to me
This soul has a lot to learn

Having the dreams of some gypsy
