Hallucinate
Desegregate
Mediate
Alleviate
Try not to hate

Love your mate
Don’t suffocate
On your own hate
Designate
Your love as fate
A one world state
As human freight
The number eight
A white black state
A gentle trait
The broken crate
A heavy weight
Or just too late
Like pretty Kate
Has sex ornate
Now devastate
Appreciate
Depreciate
Fabricate
Emulate
The truth dilate
Special date
The animal we ate
Guilt debate
The edge serrate
A better rate
The youth irate
Deliberate

Fascinate
Deviate
Reinstate
Liberate
Too moderate
Recreate
Or detonate
Annihiliate
Atomic fate

Mediate
Clear the state
Activate
Now radiate
A perfect state
Food on plate
Gravitate
The Earth’s own weight
Designate
Your love as fate
At ninety eight we all rotate

Hallucinate
Desegregate
Mediate
Alleviate
Try not to hate

Love your mate
Don’t suffocate
On your own hate
Designate
Your love as fate
A one world state
As human freight
The number eight
A white black state
A gentle trait
The broken crate

A heavy weight
Or just too late
Like pretty Kate
Has sex ornate
Now devastate
Appreciate
Depreciate
Fabricate
Emulate
The truth dilate
Special date
The animals we ate
Guilt debate
The edge serrate
A better rate
The youth irate
Deliberate
Fascinate
Deviate
And reinstate

Liberate
To liberate
Liberate
Liberate
