All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we’re leaving
Broken hearts behind

Mystify, mystify me
Mystify, mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
That tangles me
To keep me alive
In all that exists
But none has your beauty
I see your face
And I will survive

Mystify, mystify me (yea!)
Mystify, mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Will kiss you every night

All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine
Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we’re leaving
Yeah we’re leaving broken hearts behind, mm-hm

Mystify, mystify me
Mystify, mystify me

You’re eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Well, they’ll kiss you every night

Mystify, mystify me (oh!)
Mystify, mystify me
Mystify, mystify me
Mystify
