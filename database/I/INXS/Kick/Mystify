All veils and misty streets of blue
Almond looks, that chill divine
Some silken moment goes on forever
And we’re leaving broken hearts behind

Mystify, mystify me
Mystify, mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
That tangles me
To keep me alive

In all that exists
But none have your beauty
I see your face
And I will survive

Mystify, mystify me (ye!)
Mystify, you mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Well, they’ll kiss you every night

All veils and misty streets of blue
Almond looks, that chill divine
Some silken moment goes on forever
And we’re leaving, yeah we’re leaving broken hearts behind, mm-hmm

Mystify, mystify me
Mystify, you mystify me

You’re eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Well, they’ll kiss you every night

Mystify, you mystify me (oh!)
Mystify, mystify me

Mystify, you mystify me
Mystify
