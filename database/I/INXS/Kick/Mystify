All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine

Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we’re leaving
Broken hearts behind

Mystify
Mystify me
Mystify
Mystify me

I need perfection
Some twisted selection
That tangles me
To keep me alive

In all that exists
But none has your beauty
I see your face
And I will survive

Mystify
You mystify me (yea!)
Mystify
You mystify me

Eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Will kiss you every night

All veils and misty
Streets of blue
Almond looks
That chill divine

Some silken moment
Goes on forever
And we’re leaving, yeah, we’re leaving
Broken hearts behind, mmm-hm

You mystify
You mystify me
Mystify
You mystify me

You’re eternally wild with the power
To make every moment come alive
All those stars that shine upon you
Will they kiss you every night?

Mystify
You mystify me (oh!)
Mystify
You mystify me

Mystify
You mystify me
Mystify…
