Sunday night
I was riding on the A train
Reading the newspaper
A woman was trying to convince a man that she hadn’t done it

(All these years I haven’t seen you)
(Love is still the same)
(Now you must believe me)
(Now I play no game)

I know I loved you
(When I left you couldn’t tell you why)
(Too sad today, too sad for tears)
(Let me cry)

You only just caught that train, breathless
And then, you smiled at me
We left on Canal Street, and uh, had a drink at…
Remember the name of the place?

(All these years I haven’t seen you)
(Love is still the same)
(Now you must believe me)
(Now I play no games)

I know I loved you
(When I left you couldn’t tell you why)
(Too sad today, too sad for tears)
(Let me cry)

Yes, I do remember the name of the place
“Three Roses”
