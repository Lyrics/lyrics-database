The sun blowing the moon away
Lights me up for one more day
The streets are naked in the morning sun
The night, just behind me, I run and run

Morning heat puts a thin film of sweat on my face
A little man, his eyes half-closed, puts chairs on tables
Admires his work, and collects a quarter from the floor
I head over to Broadway
Where I watch myself
Having a slow breakfast
Trying to impress the barman with a fresh voice
When I ask for the bill

The sun blowing the moon away
Lights me up for one more day
The streets are naked in the morning sun
The night, just behind me, I run and run

Desire
Desire (for the unknown eyes)
Desire (for the unknown name)
I’m burning (in the morning sun, I want to run)

Desire (for the unknown name)
Desire (for the unknown love)
I’m burning…
