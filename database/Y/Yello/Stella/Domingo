We are here in this holy cave today
To celebrate the reincarnation of Domingo de Santa Clara
The man who convinced us that there is no Lord
For His name is Buddha, Allah, Shiva, Jahve, outside our bodies

We are God ’cause only we can create the idea
Of His existence in our holy brains

Je deteste l’idee de dieu et de son fils
C’est une des idees les plus diaboliques
Dans l’histoire entiere de l’homme

Let us pray to ourselves and our spirits!

Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before

Domingo of Santa Clara
You made us believe that you are no phantom when without
The slightest spot of a thousand nations you sprayed your blood of Domingo!

We all know Domingo of Santa Clara will be born today, tomorrow, and the day after
Billions of times, ’til the end of the Universe
Here with a smile on his face still rest of our species watches
The catastrophe

Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
Domingo you showed me just nothing like no one before
