Are you ever gonna push me, let me run, and let me do?
I need it, and I’m ready, and I haven’t got a clue

Any track is turning, but the race is in my head
I’m attacking the illusion, but the stopping drives me mad

Time is running out, the illusion fades away
Time is running out, another day is on its way

On the fast lane of the street I’m driving
Sometimes, somewhere, I’m arriving
Every day
And every night

Another day is ready coming up, it drives me mad
’Cos I haven’t got a notion, got a clue I need it bad

[Give me race!]

Another sun was shining and he knew he wasn’t great
He didn’t ever talk about he knew he couldn’t wait

Are you ever gonna push me let me run and let me do?
I need it and I’m ready and I haven’t got a clue

Not any track is turning, but the race is in my head
I’m attacking the illusion, but the stopping drives me mad

[Shout, shout!]
[Shout, shout!]

[Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
This is Billy McKloski from Palm Springs, reporting for NBC Sports of America.
Twenty seconds to the start of the thirty-first Formula race on a hot sunny afternoon, here in California]
