Look at his hands, look at his head
Anyone can see that this man is dead
Look at his arms, look at his back
Needles and rubber, machine gun tracks

Take him and his works, blood-stained shirt
You think you’re better, you carry the word
Make your symbol over his head
I see no point, this man is dead

Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back

Take this man, take his sin
Bless him holy father, now do it again
Take him out back, fill him with smack
Religion and needles, they both leave tracks

Look at the cross hanging round his neck
A pagan stoic symbol that marks his death
Look at his face, death in it’s place
You blessed him into heaven in this sacred place

Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back
Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back

Take him out back
