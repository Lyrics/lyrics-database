Dendrites fire a new wire
In between the gene machines
Chemicals lurk in your dreams
Close the doors to hide the screams

VDT, DDT
A chemically-inbalanced brain
Isolation breeds violent deeds
Then they come and they lock you away

Commercial dreams of a new machine
Ideas that you think are yours
A life in chains, you’re badly maimed
Working to buy all your toys

Subsonic transmission, controlling condition
Stuck like rats in a maze
A violent death is all that’s left
It’s better than life in a daze

Electronic assaults, misery exalts
A starving man left out to rust
Roll up the window like going through channels
A techno peasant bites the dust

Experts contest statistic violence
Repressive state terror machine
Look at me, I’m keeping clean
Preparing to ignore the screams
