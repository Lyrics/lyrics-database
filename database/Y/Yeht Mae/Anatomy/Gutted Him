... so hard to tell
What is really right and who went to hell
Bound by the secrets you can’t renounce
Bound by strings that hold you ...

Gutted it
Really gutted it
Got it
Really got it

... red-red sun
... people that you can’t become
... aside
Fire, fire, fire ... burn ...

Gutted him
Really gutted him
Gutted him
You really got him
Just to see

Gutted him
Really gutted him
Gutted this
You really got this
Just to see

... simple and really ...
... in the end
Think about ...
Makes it so clear
... people ...

Gutted this
Really gutted this
Gutted him
Really gutted him

You’re whore?/whole?
