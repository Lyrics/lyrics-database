A certain style, that winning smile
Gaining polls, winning fools
The way you speak, you’re never caught
When the wind blows you lose your thoughts

Justify
Justify your war
Justify
Justify your war

Human factory gains at your expense
Grinding, burning is your defense
Anxiety-blurred vision, your recompense
Company, country eat your innocence

Justify
Justify your war
Justify
Justify your war

The napalm sears, crowds they cheer
Have no fear, George ain’t queer
Everyone’s death is on his head
In deference, it was self-defense

Baby’s scream the hands they clap
Tattered third world a newsbreak
Reporting live, nowhere to hide
Uncounted dead it’s on our heads

Justify
Justify your war
Justify
Justify your war
