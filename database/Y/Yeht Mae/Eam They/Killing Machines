When I feel funky I take a few pills
Go out looking for humans to kill
I browse your clubs, streets, and your bars
Looking for humans, for spare parts

Sent here to spread the word of my god
And make better humans from all of these parts

I take mutant genes and splice in the rest
What I am making is a hell of a mess
Aberrations, perversions of the human form
Put in society where they are adored

This is my mission, creating killing machines
They kill the weak, hey they have my genes

In a primitive society I still do my best
God delivered me and is my witness
My frailed attempts at alien beings
Roam the earth with serial genes

Spliciing genes using human rage
God will delight in this warrior race
