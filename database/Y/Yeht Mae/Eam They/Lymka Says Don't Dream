Lymka says it’s time to get high
She jacks me up so I’m prepared to die

Lymka gets what Lymka wants
She buries me in deeper thoughts
Lymka gets what Lymka wants
It’s always that way

Lymka has blueprints, bombs, and plans
Drugs and sex keep me in Lymka’s hands

Lymka commands, Lymka demands
The Alien, her only man
Die for me, lie for me
I do it obediently

Lymka says it’s time to lick her knife
Lymka says, “be ready to give up your life”

Lymka knows what’s best for me
She feeds me love and candy
Lymka knows what’s best for me
After all, she raised me

Lymka says, “we can have it all”
As long as the Alien obeys her back and call

Lymka says, “it’s time to die”
Lymka says, “be ready to die”
She jacks me up and gets me high
Now I listen to her every sigh
