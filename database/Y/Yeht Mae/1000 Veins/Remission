I am the one, I have a thousand veins
I am the architect of viral pain
I planted seeds of population reduction
Race-related AIDS infection

I am the soldier dead a thousand times
In the paddy fields lay my unspent mines
Waiting for a child playing in the fields
War goes on even during peace

I am the death of a thousand races
You worship me in your history classes
I am the smiling man in your tube
Taking your vote, and your contributions, too

Everything in life is interconnected
Every bum that dies leaves us more infected
When so many die from being infliced
Pain is easy to find, it can beâ€¦ injected

It is proclaimed we must die for what's right
To preserve the status quo, so we can sleep at night
Kids will always think of some dreams
So that desperate may die with loyal screams

The planets slowly move, they are recalcitrant
The planets spin in circles under my command
We will kill ourselves by our own admission
I am incurable, I am you, in remission

Remission
