Ayy, uh

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching stand by me (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby C'est La Vie

(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie

Tall bitch I attack on titan
Need a fine VP like Biden
Trap that purp in the gold like a viking (uh)
Double cup ice like Tampa, lightning
Double cup, ain't no lean
Only sip syrup when I'm with Cheef Keef
Play clean, pipe Christine
I pipe correct, I'm so P.C.

Go to the club and I don't even drink
I don't know what to think
Got a girl with me and we pop in the kitchen
Dick all hard, my nut's on a mission
I got cash, I got coins in my mileage
E.D.D., your credit lookin' childish
Your girlfriend just changed her name to my bitch
She got LASIK, I nut on her iris (nut on her iris?)

Bored in the morning, yeah, just like a virus
Tongue game nerdy, ain't talkin' no Cyrus
Pull up on the booty, yeah, we some pirates
I don't know why, we got huge privates (woah)
I guess we're kinda blessed I can't complain about it
Every day I get another check I won't complain about it

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching stand by me (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby C'est La Vie

(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie

Bubble bath and a bucket of cash
When your bitch said, "Gravy, put it in my ass"
Let's run it, 'cause you kindly asked
And I guess I'll be a gentleman and bust a smash
But then you gotta help me smoke some gas
And count some cash and trap some hash
And then I need a ride to my cooking class
Gravy train, choo-choo, on that ass

Skrrt in a mediocre whip down Fairfax
Bitch, I'm a king, you a peasant in the barracks (bitch)
Chillin' with a porn star, life like an IMAX
Fuck grammar, one time, no syntax
Cock real hard, yeah, I'm horny for the big racks
Crack my nuts, she can juice my gonads
Baby, yes, pop star, Selena Gomez
Always make big moves, last name nomad
Troll so much, made a song called "You Mad"
Next bar Gravy says I wrote, he mad

Ooh, ayy, baby C'est La Vie
Finger licking good like it's KFC
I learned to count a mil' before my ABCs
Fuck your Delta-8, your bitch ate my D

Bitch, I'm 21 but I still walk around with fake ID (what?)
Cuddle with the homies watching stand by me (cute)
This dick ain't free, baby pay my fee (bread)
Let me live my life, baby C'est La Vie

(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
(Woo, woo)
C'est La Vie
