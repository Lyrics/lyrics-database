Hey-hey, when everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense
Hey-hey, there once was a time
I should have known better then
Hey-hey, although you may try
It won’t come your way again

Hey little girl, where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey little girl, where will you go?
Who can you turn to now?

Hey-hey, so why should I care
If somebody lets you down?
Hey-hey, that’s nothing new
I know just what that can mean
Hey-hey, well, the way that they talk
The talk is all over town
Hey-hey, and it’s no surprise
Little girls hurt sometimes

Hey little girl, where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey little girl, where will you go?
Who can you turn to now? (Who can you turn to now?)

Hey-hey, when everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense
Hey…
Hey little girl, should have known better
Known better now (now)

Hey little girl, where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey little girl, where will you go?
Who can you turn to now?
Hey little girl, where will you go?
Who can you turn to now? (Who can you turn to now?)

Hey little girl…
