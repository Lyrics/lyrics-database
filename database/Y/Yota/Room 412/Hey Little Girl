Hey-hey
When everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense
Hey-hey
There once was a time
I should have known better then
Hey-hey
Although you may try
It won’t come your way again

Hey, little girl
Where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey, little girl
Where will you go?
Who can you turn to now?

Hey-hey
So, why should I care
If somebody let you down?
Hey-hey
That’s nothing new
I know just what that can mean
Hey-hey
Well, the way that they talk
The talk is all over town
Hey-hey
And it’s no surprise
Little girls hurt sometimes

Hey, little girl
Where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey, little girl
Where will you go?
Who can you turn to now? (Who can you turn to now?)

Hey-hey
When everything goes wrong
Sometimes it makes no sense
Hey
Hey, little girl
Should have known better
Known better now (now)

Hey, little girl
Where will you hide?
Who can you run to now?
Hey, little girl
Where will you go?
Who can you turn to now?
Hey, little girl, hey
Where will you go?
Who can you turn to now? (Who can you turn to now?)
