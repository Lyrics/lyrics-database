Still holding on
Could you make up your mind?
Been holding on and on too long

There is something I should do
Memories are vivid blue
I thought it was lost but is it lost forever? (forever)

What does it really mean
When we say it’s over yet we feel
Just like a cut that doesn’t heal
What does it really mean
When I feel I’m failing constantly? (constantly)
As the chains are holding me, yet telling I am free…

I still feel the same
No damn matter how I try
Like a burning flame
Are we holding on or will we break it?

Still holding on
Could you make up your mind?
Been holding on and on too long

Still holding on
Could you make up your mind?

Are we holding on or will we break it?

Hah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aaah
I’ll do what it takes to save (now)
I wanna do it (now)
I wanna do it

I’ll never be the one
The one you want me to become
’Cause I’ll be so much better
And we’re having fun (having fun)

I read the signs and feel alive
Each time I think of you and I
It tears me up inside
When you’re not mine

Still, I still feel the same
No damn matter how I try
Like a burning flame
Are we holding on or will we break it?

Still holding on
Could you make up your mind?
Been holding on and on too long

Still holding on
Could you make up your mind?
Are we holding on or will we break it?

Hah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-aaah
I’ll do what it takes to save (now)
I wanna do it (now)
I wanna do it

Now
Now
Now
