Are you here?
Did you notice?
I can hear you
Every breath is moving closer, you can’t hide
I don’t want this
But it feeds me
In the darkest deepest corners of my mind…

(Aah-aah-aah)

I guess it should have stayed as a fantasy
Crossed the line through reality
A breakthrough
Now it hits me just as hard I knew it would…

(Why, why, ah)

I tried so hard to let things go
But every time we close that door
Deep in the core, a distant call that says, “I need you”
It’s getting darker than before
We watch it slowly take control
I try to hide, but realise that I still I miss you

Ah-ah-ah

I don’t know how
I don’t know how

(Ah-aah-aah-aah)

I don’t know why
Why…
Why…

Are you here?
Did you notice?
I don’t fear you
We don’t touch, but still it feels just so damn right
You don’t need this
But it feeds me (reunite)
In the darkest deepest corners we unite…

(Ah-aah-aah-aah)
(Ah-aah-aah-aah)
