I can’t seem to get you
Cannot seem to get my mind off you
(My mind off you)
Mind off you

I can’t seem to get through
Cannot seem to get inside of you
(Inside of you)
Inside of you

Does it feel good?
Does it feel like it used to?
Dark Dandy
In your mind

Does it feel good?
Does it feel like it should do?
Dark Dandy

I need you now, so don’t you make me cry
Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
I need you now, so don’t you make me cry
Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me

Haaah, all over again
Don’t do it over again
After all this time
Do you ever start to wonder
How?
How it would feel like?
How it would feel to make it
Feel to make it,
Feel to make it,
Feel to make it right?

Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
I need you now so don’t you make me cry
Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
Haaah, all over again

Days are passing by (counting them)
Soon it’s out of sight
I still hear you calling
Calling!

It’s chasing
He’s chasing me
Again
And you’ll chase me ’til the end

Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
I need you now, so don’t you make me cry
Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
Haaah, all over again

Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
I need you now, so don’t you make me cry
Don’t hurt, don’t hurt me
Haaah, all over again
