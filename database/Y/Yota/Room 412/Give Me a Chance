Huuh-uuh-huuh-huu
Huuh-huuh-huuh-huu

Yeah-huuh
Huuh-uuh-huuh-huuh-yeah, ah

Gone

Us not talking anymore has slowly made you go insane
Slowly insane
I want to make you understand that all I needed was a change
Just one change

You read it in a letter
I’m just trying to make this better
Seems I can’t let go

Give me a chance
Oh, give me a chance

And it tears me up inside

Us not talking anymore has made me think it was in vain
Since you turned the page
I failed to make you understand that all I needed was a change
Just one change

You read it in a letter
I’m just trying to make this better
Seems I can’t let go

Give me a chance
Oh, give me a chance
Give me a chance

You read it in a letter
I’m just trying to make this better
Seems I can’t let go

You read it in a letter
I’m just trying to make this better
Things have changed, I know
Don’t break it

Us not talking anymore has slowly made you go insane
I want to make you understand that all I needed was a change
Just one change

Give me a chance
Oh, give me a chance

Give me a chance
(Oh-oh…)
Oh, give me a chance
(Give me a chance)
(Oh, let’s try)
Give me a chance

Don’t tell me
Don’t say it’s
Gone

Can’t understand you
Lately you’re behaving like a fool
