A Heart made out of gold
Those hands that kept me out from the cold
A mind out of control
You thought you’d save me and never let go

Sometimes I think of the things you’ve told me
Guess you gave it all
Seems you had enough
Your silence says goodbye

Don’t tell me…

Don’t tell me why
Don’t make it quick
I need it now to stop the pain I’m living in
(Deep inside)

Don’t tell me why
Don’t make it quick
I’m breathing now you keep the dark from breaking in
Dark…

Sometimes I think of the things you’ve told me
Guess you gave it all
Seems you had enough
Your silence says goodbye

Don’t tell me…

Deep inside

Don’t tell me why
Don’t make it quick
I’m breathing now you keep the dark from breaking in
Dark…

I need you now, so please don’t walk away
I need you now, so please don’t walk away
I need you now, so please don’t walk away
I need you now, so please don’t walk away
