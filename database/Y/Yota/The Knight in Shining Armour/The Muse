Huuh-uuuh…
Huuh-uuuh…
Huuh-uuuh…
Huuh-uuuh…

So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?

You’re hiding fear behind that face
And play your part with so much grace
You say you’re kind and that you will never hurt me
So keep that lie way deep inside before it breaks

How I hate to see you smile and to pretend
You don’t want me, but you just don’t like the end
If you could, then you would choose somebody else
But as long as you are here, we can’t be friends

I’ll play your fool beneath your throne, and you’ll be king
I’ll play your fool beneath your throne, if you want it
Who’s gonna fall deep down and more when there’s nothing?
who’s gonna fall deep down and more in the end?

So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, huuh-uuuh, is that what you want, me?
So-so-ooh, huuh-uuuh, is that what you want to?

Who’s gonna fall, deep down and more, when there’s nothing?
who’s gonna fall, deep down and more, in the end?

So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, is that what you need?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want me?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
So-so-ooh, is that what you need?
So-so-ooh, is that what you want to?
