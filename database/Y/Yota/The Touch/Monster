My heart must be mistaking
How hard it is to let you go, oh-o-oh
Sail away
In a forever sea

And if it hurts
You will be painfully ignored (always, yeah)
And when it bleeds
I know you secretly adore the signs

Is it alive?
Does it creep around and make you cry?
And if it wants to live
Baby, kill it one more time

Deep into its eyes I stared, and saw it cry (like a distant sigh)
Funny how it sometimes felt as if it’s still alive
All the signs we used to chase are now invisible
Only fractions of a monster could appear sometimes

'Cause if heaven is calling
Then I start to realise
That the angels are falling
And we’ll never make them fly — so It’s over

Is it alive, a-ah?
Does it creep around and make you cry, a-ah-aah?
And if it wants to live
Baby, kill it one more time

It’s time
Baby, I can’t take it
Signs
I’m gone, there’s nothing left to see

Than a monster
In our minds
Than a monster
In our minds
