On a shore, right by the sea
All those colours that made me believe
I was lost and thought that it was real
But somewhere in real time — it slowly starts to disappear

From me, from you
A-aah
From me, from you
A-aah, a-aah

Don’t fade out, come save me
From falling
Keep walking side by side
Beneath the city lights

We’re fading
But they can’t take me
As long as you are mine
Side by side

Don’t let me fall, no!
(City lights and you, yeah, forever)

(City lights and you, yeah, forever)

Along that road, right in-between
Where our path divides, your world and me
I will cross and fall to have you near
If only one last time — before I have to set you free

From me, from you
A-aah
From me, from you
A-aah, a-aah

Don’t fade out, come save me (come save me)
From falling (from falling)
Keep walking side by side
(Beneath the city lights)

We’re fading (we’re fading out)
But they can’t take me
As long as you are mine
Side by side

Don’t let me fall, no!
(City lights and you, yeah, forever)

Come save me
A-a-aah, a-a-aah
