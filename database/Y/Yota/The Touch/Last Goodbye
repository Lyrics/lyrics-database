The skies tonight are made
Of the colours that we like
Illuminating all that pain
We hide

You said that I failed
So we’re gonna make this the last goodbye
You said that I failed
So it’s gonna take all I have to slowly let you go

A distant cry says, “please, let’s try”
We’ll watch it fall asleep, it’s time
So full of grace
Will miss that face
I’ve never seen it shine so bright
No, oh-hah
So we’re gonna make this the last (goodbye)

We’ll slowly erase the sky
Pretend that it doesn’t feel
Envision that we were blind
Forget that the pain was real — ’cause it was raw

This… the last goodbye

We’ll slowly erase the sky
Pretend that it doesn’t feel
Envision that we were blind
Forget that the pain was real

(This… the last goodbye)
