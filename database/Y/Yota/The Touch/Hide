Staying, lingering sound
Staying, lingering sound
Still holding on
Still holding on

But those days are gone

Oh maybe, I’m not who you want me to be
But I’ll be the one that stays — I’m the echo in your brain
The melody won’t die
Die, die

Realise, faced eye-to-eye it’s never gonna be
Never be what he wants to see, never
What he wants to hide from me
Hide, hide from me hide

Oh maybe, I’m not who you want me to be
But I’ll be the one that stays — I’m the echo in your brain
The melody won’t die
Die, die

Oh maybe, I’m not who you want me to be
But I’ll be the one that stays — I’m the echo in your brain
The melody won’t die
Die, die
