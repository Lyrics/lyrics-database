There is no good explanation
All I just can say is, “things are changing”
Tried to stop this locomotion
But when you are around, I just can’t fake it

If you think that it’s right
Then why not come back for some more?
If it feels like before
Then I’m not gonna fight, am I?

I will catch you
If it feels like you’re falling
I will stand by your side
Starting to realise we can’t let this die

Under the rain — that’s where I found you
Where our worlds collide — that’s where I see that
No one feels like you
I won’t see you cry

Oh baby, believe when I say that I thought there was no one, no one
That could make me feel this way
It’s so, so different, o-oh
Come back to me, baby

I wanna feel like before
I wanna feel like before, oh-ooh-oh-oh

(I wanna feel like before)
(I wanna feel like before)
