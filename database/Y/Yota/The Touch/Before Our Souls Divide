Before our souls divide
You burned all down

Each every time I just feel like I am losing you
(Did we lose it all, did we rise and fall?)
Each every time you were the violent sun that burned all down
(Did we burn it down, did it burn all down?)

Now it seems you couldn’t change, so we’ll break apart
Now it seems there’s just no way to tame a wild heart
That never heals
When we’re facing the night…

Turn off the lights
’Cause it’s in the dark the truth lies
Cover up your eyes
And sacrifice

We’ll pray before our souls divide (before our souls divide)

The things you do
Why are you holding on to me, why?
The things you feel when you’re all alone
Opens up your darkness, and it’s pushing you away

Now it seems you’re holding fear deep inside that heart
Now it seems that we’re pulling each other into the dark
Before we leave
Where we’re facing the night…

Turn off the lights
’Cause it’s in the dark the truth lies
Cover up your eyes
And sacrifice — we’ll pray

Before our souls divide (before our souls divide)
Before our souls divide
Before our souls divide

You burned all down
Ha-aa-aah
You burned it all down

Before our souls divide…
