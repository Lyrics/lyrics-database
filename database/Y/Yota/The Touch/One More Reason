I can’t give you more, give baby, ’cause all we had is gone

Another night when you’re away
Where nothing is like before, ha-aa-ah
Another night, another day
Where time stands still, and you’re gone

Even though I feel like before, we both know
I can’t give you more, give baby, no
Even though I feel like before, when everything else is wrong
I can’t give you more, give baby, no

Breakthrough
When violent forces cut me loose — breaking down the walls I had
Bring me back to life, you knew
To pull the strings that turn me mad

So I’ll give you one more reason not to love me
I can’t give you more, give baby, all those forces turning mad
Tearing down ha-aah-aah, tearing down, oh yeah
I can’t give you more, give baby, ’cause all we had is gone

The light we used to see is fading
It all will start to drift apart — these ties would not hold the weight a hundredth time
The ground beneath your throne is breaking
A silence that speaks louder than a lie (than a lie)

Ha-aah, oh-ooh
You made it all fall apart
And I will watch it slow
We’re losing this game, ha-aah-ah-ah-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooh

Breakthrough
When violent forces cut me loose — breaking down the walls I had
Bring me back to life, you knew
To pull the strings that turn me mad

So I’ll give you one more reason not to love me
I can’t give you more, give baby, all those forces turning mad
Tearing down ha-aa-aah, tearing down, oh yeah
I can’t give you more, give baby, ’cause all we had is gone
