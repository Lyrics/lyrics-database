You say that you’re falling in love
Then it fades
You say that you’re falling in love
Then it fades

I don’t want to love you
I don’t want to stay and watch you slowly drift away
I don’t want to love you
I don’t want to drown into the darkness of your shade

I’m never gonna tell you how
How, how it aches
I’m never gonna tell you how
How, how it breaks

(I’m never gonna tell you) our moon is fading
(Tell you why) We’ll face the darkness deep inside
This game is ending
I’ll bring this pain into the light

The change was calling
A distant voice inside my mind
When fears are falling
That’s when I know I’ll be alright

You say that you’re falling in love (you say that)
Then it fades
You say that you’re falling in love
Then it fades (you say that)

I don’t want to love you (don’t)
I don’t want to stay and watch you slowly drift away (don’t, I don’t want to feel like this
I don’t want to love you (don’t)
I don’t want drown into the darkness of your shade (don’t, this is not what we had)

Our moon is fading
We’ll face the darkness deep inside
This game is ending
I’ll bring this pain into the light

The change was calling
A distant voice inside my mind
When fears are falling
That’s when I know I’ll be alright

(This is not what we had)
I’m never gonna tell you
Tell you why

Then it fades…
