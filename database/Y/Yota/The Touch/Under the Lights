I don’t know why you haunt me, why did you go?
No one makes me feel the way that I feel when I’m with you
Under the lights, your hand and mine — just like a dream
No one makes me feel the way that I feel when I’m with you

Under the lights
I’ve seen the signs so many times
Each and every day
Deep in slow motion, watch us drift away

Lately I just know what I should not do
Was to push you away when all you did was to try
To feel like me
All from the start

Lately I just know that you tried to prove
If I give you the space then time will help us to find
Reveal the signs
Reach the divine

Baby I don’t wanna pretend that I’m not falling
High…
’Cause this is how I
I feel for you

Oh-ooh, slowly we’re drifting in space
Deep in slow motion watch us drift away…

Oh, hard to give it up, it’s you I’m wanting
Deep in slow motion, watch us drift away…

’Cause baby I don’t wanna pretend no more

(In slow motion, deep in slow motion, deep in slow motion, deep in slow motion…)
