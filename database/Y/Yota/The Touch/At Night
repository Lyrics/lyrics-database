Why don’t you try with me?
’Cause I want to know
So why, why don’t you try with me?
We can’t keep it low and hide

So if I give you just another reason, would you come my way?
You gave me the look with your eyes
It’s hot and I feel alone
Tell me… now

Defences falling
When it’s late
At night, they start to howl at you
Howl at me now

So if I give you just another reason, would you come my way?
You gave me the look with your eyes
It’s hot and I feel alone
Howl at me now

I can hear them howling for you
At night
I can hear them calling for two
That’s right

Defences falling
Stay awake
At night, and start to break some rules
Break some rules now

So if I give you just another reason, would you come my way?
You gave me the look with your eyes
It’s hot and I feel alone
Howl at me now

I can hear them howling for you
At night
I can hear them calling for two
That’s right

I can hear them howling for you
At night
I can hear them calling for two
That’s right

Tell me… now
