Systematic
Step-by-step, closer to
The ecstatic
Gravitating to you

Elevate my mind
Somewhere high above the sky — that’s where we meet
Elevate my mind
Level up and rise up to my mood — so divine

We’re falling in love
Again with the touch
Disappear in your vision of me
Slow, slow delay
Disappear in your vision of me
Slow, slow delay
Disappear in your vision of me

So… so divine…
So… so divine…

In my vision I still drown in you
(I still) drown in you
(Slowly dive) drown in you (hah)
Drown in you

We’re falling in love
Again with the touch
Disappear in your vision of me
Slow, slow delay
Disappear in your vision of me

A burning flame
Untameable like you
There’s no escape, I’ll get lost and face
The fire with your embrace

(When we start to feel firem the fire burns in you)
In you…

We’re falling in love (I still)
Again with the touch
We’re falling in love (I still)
Again with the touch
Disappear in your vision of me

Drown…
In slow motion…
