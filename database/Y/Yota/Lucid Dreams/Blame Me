Blame me
I’m into you and into your realm
Save me
You’ll always be on high demand

If I go under I wanna see you
I’m going under
I’m gonna make you understand
Deny — No one lies like you do

You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again

You’re coming closer
So much closer than you had before
I’ve kept my distance
But this distance makes you ask for more

(And I feel like a fool)
Hard to, yeah
(Like a freaking fool)
Hard to, yeah

Blame me
Go on and blame me
Save me
Go on and save me

(O-ooh-oh-aah-ah)
(O-ooh-oh-aah-ah)

Letting go
Holding on to it
Letting go
Holding on to it
Letting go
Letting go of it, aah-ah

(And I have been a fool)
(And I have been a fool)
(And I have been a fool)
For you
For you

Give me
That sacred soul, don’t keep it within
Show me
What’s deep inside, let it just appear

If I go under, I wanna see you
I’m going under
I’m gonna make you understand
Deny — No one lies like you do

You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
You keep on coming back again
