Did they notice
The look in your eyes?
Color when it fades
Darker to dark as the night

I wish I could (I wish I could)
Be by your side
I wish I could (I wish I could)
Hurt the way it hurts when you’re not mine

(Not mine)
(Not mine)

I want to ...

Show me your fears
Cast all your lies
Bring me those tears
And if you will hurt me then I’ll hurt you too

Did they notice
The look in your eyes?
Color when it fades
Darker to dark as the night

Feel me now, now
Feel me now, ah-ah
Feel me now, now
Feel me now, ah-ah

I wish I could enter your mind
I wish I could hurt the way it hurts when you’re inside
Hurt the way it hurts when you’re not mine
Darker to dark as the night

The look in your eyes
The look in your eyes
The look in your eyes
The look in your eyes

(Not mine)
(Not mine)
