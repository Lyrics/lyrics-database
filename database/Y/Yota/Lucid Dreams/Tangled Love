I…
I'm caught in a dream
I, I…
I wish it was real
Oh-ah

Well nothing will keep us apart
Well nothing will tear us apart
Until the last breath, until the final dance
Until the light comes, until the shadows take over me

It's tangled love
Tangled love
It's tangled love
Twisted, complicated, and confused

Try, try
... to ...
Try, try
Is it coming apart?

Seems nothing will keep us apart
Well nothing will tear us apart
Until the last breath, until the final dance
Until the light comes, until the shadows take over me

It's tangled love
Tangled love
It's tangled love
Twisted, complicated, and confused

I…
I…

Ah, we hold onto
The light that keeps on shining through
All night
...

...
...
Yet still we try
... to reignite
... ...

Until the last breath until the final dance
Until the light comes until the shadows take over me

It's tangled love
Tangled love
It's tangled love
Twisted, complicated, and confused

I…
I…
