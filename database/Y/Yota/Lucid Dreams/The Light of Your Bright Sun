I’m no good
I’m no good with you tonight
That’s alright
I guess that’s alright

I’m no good
I’m no good, I tell you lies
But you’ll be fine

Sun rising
And I can't see
But you’ll never get the hold of me

Flames
That brought me tears
But you’ll never get the best of me now

Light of your bright,
Light of your bright sun is killing me
You’re killing me

Light of your bright,
Light of your bright sun is killing me
You’re killing me

He-ee-ee-ey

Sun rising
And I can't see
But you’ll never get the hold of me

It’s burning
I'm on fire
... my heart
...
...
...
