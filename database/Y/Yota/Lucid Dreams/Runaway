I’m gonna go
I wanna runaway, uuh
You were a dream
And I ain’t gonna stay

Won’t care about you
No, I won’t
Ain’t thinking of you
Anymore

Emotions will fade
One by one
Like day after day
Keep moving on

Won’t care about you
No, I won’t
Ain’t thinking of you
Anymore

Fading (I can’t change things)
It all will be gone (I can’t)
Fading
I will let you go
Slowly (time goes by)
Reclaiming control of me (yeah)

Are you still alone?
Alone
Are you still alone?
Alone (’cause you can’t let go of me!)

But I can (but I can!)
But I can (but I can!)
But I can (but I can!)
But I can…

Still thinking of you
Hear the echo of that voice
I wanna hold you
But you won’t give me no choice

I’ll break it
Until it all falls down
Can’t take it
I’m never going back again
Never, no
I’m never going back again

Still thinking of you… yeah…
