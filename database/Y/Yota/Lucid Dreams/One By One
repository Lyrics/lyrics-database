Force, a sudden force in me, I cannot stay
This is a game I cannot play
Emotion messing with my brain
Oh no, not again

No one knows
Me like you do
No one breaks
Sometimes aharder spur loves you

No one understands
I’d change this if I could
Don’t you know I tried but failed
To save what once was mine?

I’m on my own again, alone again
Tonight I’m facing every fear, one by one
Alone again, belong again
Can’t hide a pain that is too real

No one feels
Pain like we do
Now we see those fears
Were darker than we knew

No one understands
We’ll change this if we could
It’s a last goodbye, this face
We’re forced to follow through

I’m on my own again, alone again
Tonight I’m facing every fear, one by one
Alone again, we are again
The love that makes you disappear, come on

Who’s gonna lead me home?
Who’s gonna clear this sight?
I mean to let you go
And they shall never die

These moments passed so slow
I’m diving in your soul
Deep in the sea we flow
And watch you drown tonight

Who’s gonna lead me home?
Who’s gonna clear this sight?
I mean to let you go
And they shall never die

These moments passed so slow
I’m diving in your soul
Deep in the sea we flow
And watch you drown tonight

Makes you disappear
Makes you disappear
Makes you disappear
Makes you disappear
Makes you disappear (oh)

The light that makes you disappear
