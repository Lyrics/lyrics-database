Things are moving faster
They will try and chase you
You can go much farther
They will never get that close
They will never get that close
They will never get there

Break, break through!
You will never fail again
Never lose
You will fight it ’til the end

This time you’ll discover
They will try and break you
You can go much longer
They will never get that close
They will never get that close
They will never get there

Break, break through!
You will never fail again
Never lose
You will fight it ’til the end

Moving faster
They’re out of sight
Moving faster
You’ll get it right
Moving faster
Moving faster
Moving faster
Moving faster
You’ll get it right
Moving faster
They’re out of sight
They’re out of sight
They’re out of sight
Out of sight

You will never fail again
You will fight it ’til the end

Break, break through!
You will never fail again
Never lose
You will fight it ’til the end
