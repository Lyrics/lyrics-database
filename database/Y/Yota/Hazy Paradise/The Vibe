The time is here to make things roll
The time is here to make a change and let it go

Suddenly it feels,
Suddenly it feels like a brand new place
Time to make it real, I’m on my way

I’m driving on my own tonight
I’m on my way back home tonight
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive

The sight is clear, I’m going home
The sight is clear, I’m on my lane and on my own

Suddenly it feels,
Suddenly it feels like a brand new place
Time to make it real, I’m on my way

I’m driving on my own tonight
I’m on my way back home tonight
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive

Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive

Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel…

I’m driving on my own tonight
I’m on my way back home tonight
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive

Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive

Where I can breathe, where I can feel alive
