Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Went down the hill, other day
My soul got happy and stayed all day
Went down the hill, other day
My soul got happy and stayed all day

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Went in the room, didn’t stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead
Went in the room, didn’t stay long
Looked on the bed and brother was dead

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?

Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Oh, Lordy now, troubles so hard
Don’t nobody know my troubles but God?
Don’t nobody know my troubles begun?
