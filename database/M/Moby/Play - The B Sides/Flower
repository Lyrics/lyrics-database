Bring sally up
And bring sally down
Lift and squat
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground
Gotta tear the ground

Ol’ Miss Lucy’s dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Bring sally up
And bring sally down
Lift and squat
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.

Ol’ Miss Lucy’s dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Bring sally up
And bring sally down
Lift and squat
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.

Ol’ Miss Lucy’s dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan

Bring sally up
And bring sally down
Lift and squat
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.
Gotta tear the ground.

Ol’ Miss Lucy’s dead and gone
Left me here to weep and moan
