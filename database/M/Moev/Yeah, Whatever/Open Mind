Now the boys are beating down your door
What do you have to hound me for?
I can keep an open mind

I could make a little sacrifice
Then my heart wouldn’t keep me alive
I can keep an open mind
But my heart’s for no one

But my heart’s for no one
I can keep an open mind

Look at the masses of madmen
Warning me politely to join them
I’ll keep an open mind
