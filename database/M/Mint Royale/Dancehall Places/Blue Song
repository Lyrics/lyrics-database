Ooh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Oh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ow, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ooh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ooh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ooh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ooh, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more, I said
Step some more, I said, pick me up
Thinkin’ I got a lot, groovy I am

Ow, right through my head
I ain’t got the blues no more I said
Ooh, right through my head
Ooh, right through my head
