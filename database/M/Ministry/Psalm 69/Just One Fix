[Never trust a junkie]

Blood keeps drifting your way
Certain of its destination
Driving through New Orleans at night
Gotta find a destination

Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)

Life keeps slipping away
Fighting in a war with damnation
Poised, keep cutting away
I’m looking in through to salvation

Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)

[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]

[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]
[Just one fix]

[Only one fix, only one fix]

[But he never does]

[Hope he never does]

Like if I boarded a train
Trying to take in another station
Join us and the choice will be made
Unless we kill the lie as a nation

Just one fix [just one fix]
Just one fix [just one fix]
Just one fix [just one fix]
Just one fix [just one fix]

Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)

Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
Just one fix (one fix, one fix)
