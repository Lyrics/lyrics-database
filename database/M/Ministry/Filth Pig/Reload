(Three… two… one… roll five.)

You got something to say
You better jump in my face

Aim!
Reload!

You got something to hide
'Cause there ain't shit at your side

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!
Reload!

You say it’s time to collect
I’ll kick your ass and eject

Aim!
Reload!

It's time to settle the score
I'll show your ass to the door

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!
Reload!

(Uh)

(Uh)

Aah…

Aim!
Reload!

You wanna lie like a dog
You’re gonna wake up with fleas

Aim!
Reload!

Inside a world full of shit
You’re still an asshole to me

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!
Reload!

Aim!
Reload!
