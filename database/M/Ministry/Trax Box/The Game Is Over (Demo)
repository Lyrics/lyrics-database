Is it certainly broken?
Have we run our course?
All the gestures token
Things are getting rough, but
We don’t care it’s broken

One final parting shot
It’s the one heard ’round the world
In part that we landed
We wind up far apart, but
We don’t care it’s broken

Ten times I hit you
Ten times you hit me back
Now the score is even
It’s my turn for attack, but
We don’t care it’s broken

We don’t care it’s broken

I don’t understand what makes you act this way
I've given my all
Think fast about the past
Is there any other way? (is there any other way?)

“At last, it’s finally over” —
That’s what she would say
We may have disagreed
But then I’m always late
We don’t care it’s broken

We don’t care it’s broken

I don’t understand what makes you act this way
I've given my all
Think fast about the past
Is there any other way? (is there any other way?)

Hit hard below the belt
Yes, make it hurt
Yes, make it felt
Dig fast, move out today
There is no other way (there is no other way)

We don’t care it’s broken

I don’t understand what makes you act this way
I've given my all
Think fast about the past
Is there any other way? (is there any other way?)

Think hard about today
This game is over
This game is over
This game is over
This game is over
This game is over
This game is over
This game is over
