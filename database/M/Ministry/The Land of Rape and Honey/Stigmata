Stronger than reason
Stronger than lies
The only truth I know
Is the look in your eyes — The look in your eyes, ah!

Just like a car crash
Just like a knife
My favorite weapon
Is the look in your eyes — You’ve run out of lies!

You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
There’s a ton locked in your empty eyes — Get out of my life!

I’m chewing on glass
And eating my fingers
I’m not the one
Who’s run out of lies — Lies!

You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies
You’ve run out of lies — You’ve run out of time!

Cutting my face
And walking on splinters
I lost my soul
To the look in your eyes — Your eyes!

You ran out of lies
You ran out of lies
You ran out of lies
You ran out of time — Stigmata!

Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
Oh, you have empty eyes (lies)
They tell me nothing, nothing but lies (lies)
(Lies)

(Lies)
