Now is an angel there?
Now is an angel there?
Now is an angel there?

One left out when they passed heaven about
What about me sitting here in my purgatory?
So left out
He's dead
I'm alive
He's spared

Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there

One like me
We try so hard
Five like you
Someone dead again

Where's your angel now?
Where's your angel now?
Where's your morals now?
Where's your morals?

Always an angel there

Where's your angel now?

Always an angel who cares
Always an angel there

Where's your morals?

There's always an angel who cares

There's always an angel there

No more people staring
No more fatal dares
Like a baby grabbing at
Something that isn't there
But it is
But it is

Always an angel there
Always an angel who cares

Always an angel there
Always an angel who cares
