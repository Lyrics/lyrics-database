So many years I just suffered through the tears
Knowing one day I’d wake up wishing I had never met her
But as the time goes by, my hope keeping playing every day
As I laugh to myself, “I just should have known better”

There’s no more laughter as I think about the other girl
It’s a slap in my face as I’m opening her letter
She’s doing fine now with two kids and another man
As I cry out loud, “I just should have known better”

She was the reason I were living every day
I would ride upon a white horse in my quest to try and find her
But now it’s too late, I don’t care if I die tonight
’Cause a voice keeps ringing in my heart, “I should have known better”

I learned my lesson this time
Loneliness and a broken heart
Should’ve known right from the start

I learned my lesson this time
Loneliness and a broken heart
Should’ve known right from the start

I learned my lesson this time
Loneliness and a broken heart
