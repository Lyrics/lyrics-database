Who’s on trial?
The state says it’s me
Or is it the lawyer I handsomely paid to go free?
Or maybe the judge with the yellowing teeth, and the fuck-you smile?
Or how ’bout the bailiff who stinks of a longstanding battle of him and the drink?
Or candidate number four
The zombified whore
Who types what you think? (who types what you think)

I’m not lying
I’m not clean
I’m not buying
What that means

How the fuck can you say that we won for the criminal sum you were paid
Then try and convince me I’m free as can be
You just sold me out and got nothing in trade
I trade, but I’m not the smartest guy in the world
But I’m just not stupid enough to be thinking that having a record for filling my lungs
Is as good as it gets

I’m not lying
I’m not clean
I’m not buying
What that means

Life on a razor
Die as a story

Five more years of pissing in little jars
So someone can say he’s high as a kite
He’s probably right
Let’s put him away without further delay (further delay)
There’s no complaints, since I’m not a saint or in jail
But if I should fail with a piss
That has drugs on the forbidden list
Then they’ll be coming to take me away (to take me away)

I’m not lying
I’m not clean
I’m not buying
What that means

Live on a razor
Death could be gory
