Drunk skinhead with an attitude
Doing circles like a shark with his food
If someone tries to turn the other cheek
He disappears in a yellow streak

Animosity!
Animosity!

The only world I know is drowning in rage
Iâ€™m underwater from my dreams to the stage
In any language that you learn to speak
Love is listed and defined as weak

Animosity!
Animosity!

Animosity!
Animosity!

Animosity and common hate
Feeds the hungry on an empty plate
Bitter taste and the promise of pain
Fills you up while the soul is drained

Animosity!
Animosity!
