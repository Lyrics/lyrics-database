Shame, such a shame, I think I kind of lost myself again
Day, yesterday, I really should be leaving but I stay
Say, say my name, I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain, it's easy to remember when it came

'Cause it feels like I've been, I've been here before
You are not my saviour but I still don't go
Feels like something that I've done before
I could fake it but I still want more

Fade, made to fade, passion's overrated anyway
Say, say my name, I need a little love to ease the pain
I need a little love to ease the pain, it's easy to remember when it came

'Cause it feels like I've been, I've been here before
You are not my saviour but I still don't go
Feels like something that I've done before
I could fake it but I still want more, oh
