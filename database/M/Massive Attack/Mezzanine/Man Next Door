There's a man that live next door 
In my neighborhood, in my neighborhood
He gets me down...
He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight, always a fuss and fight 
All through the night

I've got to get away from here, this is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family, and find a quiet place

Hear the pots and pans they fall
Bang against the wall, bang against the wall
No rest at all
He gets in so late at night
Always a fuss and fight, always a fuss and fight 
All through the night

I've got to get away from here, this is not a place for me to stay
I've got to take my family, and find a quiet place

There's a man that live next door
In my neighborhood, in my neighborhood 
He gets me down...
He gets in so late at night,
Always a fuss and fight, always a fuss and fight
All through the night

Gotta get away, oh my my
