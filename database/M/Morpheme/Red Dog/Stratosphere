Something is wrong
With the record
Beautiful song
But the backbeat
Riding along
With your headphones on

Everything is bright
On the outside
Out of your mind
For the shut-eye
Nothing is bright
With your blinders on

... ...
Of dillusion ...
...
Put it in
Put it in

Everything’s wrong
With the writing
Hide in the dark
...
... deception
... on

Something is wrong
With the picture
Everything is bright
In perspective
... lights
...

... ...
Of dillusion ...
...
Put it in
Put it in

What’s wrong with the record?
What’s wrong with the writing?
What’s wrong with the picture?

Your dillusion
An illusion
...
Put it in
Put it in
