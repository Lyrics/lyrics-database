(Hush me, touch me)
Perfume, the wind, and the leaves
(Hush me, touch me)
The burns, the holes in the sheets

I’m hoping the smoke
Hides the shame I’ve got on my face
Cognac and broken glass
All these years I’ve been your ashtray

(Not today)

I found a pink cigarette
On the bed the day that you left
And how can I forget that your lips were there?
Your kiss goes everywhere, touches everything but me

(Hush me, touch me)
Champagne, your hair in the breeze
(Hush me, touch me)
Lipstick, a slap on my cheek

Your eyes cried at last
Told me everything I was afraid to ask
Now I’m dressed in white
And you’ve burned me for the last time

(This ain’t the last time)

I found a pink cigarette
On the bed the day that you left
And how can I forget that your lips were there?
Your kiss goes everywhere, touches everything but me

You’ll find a note and you’ll see my silhouette

(My silhouette)

There’s just 5 hours left until you find me dead

(Dead)

There’s just 4 hours left until you find me dead

(Dead)

There’s just 3 hours left until you find me dead

(Dead)

There’s just 2 hours left until you find me dead

(Find me dead)

There’s 1 more hour and then you will find me dead

(Find me dead)

There’s just…
