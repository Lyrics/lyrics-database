Before you advertise
All the fame is implied
With no fortune unseen
Sell the right
To your blight
Time machine

While I’m dulled by excess (dulled by excess)
And a cynic at best (cynic at best)
My art imitates crime
Paid for by
The allies
So invest

Now I’m finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized

There’s a vintage thirst returning
But I’m sheltered by my channel-surfing
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo

A tribute to false memories
With conviction
Cheap imitation
Is it fashion or disease?
Post-ironic
Remains a mouth to feed

Sell the right
To your blight
And you’ll eat

Now I’m finding truth is a ruin
Nauseous end that nobody is pursuing
Staring into glassy eyes
Mesmerized

See the vintage robot wearied
Then awakened by revision theories
Every famine virtual
Retrovertigo
