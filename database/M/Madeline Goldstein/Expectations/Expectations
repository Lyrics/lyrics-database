Expectations are the gun
Execution style fun
I won’t stop ’til it is done
I won’t go ’til it’s everyone

Breathing in, breathing out
Filling up, my sense of doubt
Turn my body inside out
Turn my body inside out

Kill me now
While I’m on fire
Run me out
With your desire

I would kill if I could see
What this body’s meant to be
Moving slow and heavily
Bring that body close to me

Speaking of, speaking to
All the movement I can do
Turn my inside out to you
Turn my inside out to you

Kill me now
While I’m on fire
Run me out
With your desire

I won’t go
You can stay
Don’t tell me
It’s okay

Held too closе
For too long
Make what’s right
Turn to wrong
