Well, it’s Halloween again
And L.A. is a bore
Everybody’s lookin’ like they wish they’d stayed inside
And they were watchin’ Frankenstein
In their beds and on their phones
Not me, baby
Tonight I’m really living

I’m a vampire again
I’m coming for you
Open up your window
’Cause I’m about to sail in
You can call for momma
But she won’t know what to do
I’m a vampire again

Umm

It’s been long time waitin’
But I’m happy to reveal
I can smell you from a thousand yards:
Fresh white linen
Felt like only yesterday
I was as wicked as Woody Allen
Now I stand as proud and tall
As the home where you were born

I’m a vampire again
And I’m coming for you
So keep that window open
I’m a swooper and you know it
Cry for momma
But she won’t know what to do
I’m a vampire again

Umm

But it’s me, babe
It’s really me
It’s your boy
And I hope you’ve been keepin’ it sweet for me
’Cause I woke up a hunger
Midnight glory
I swear, you won’t feel a single thing until the year 2025

Oh, oh

Va-va-va-va-va-va-va-va

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
