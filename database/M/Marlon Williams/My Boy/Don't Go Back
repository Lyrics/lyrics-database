One in the morning when the mood started shifting
All the night moves coming out
Conversation you could do without
You’re bored of it
But she’s got her finger in her mouth
And you know what that’s about

Don’t have to tell you what you already know
If you’ve got something to uphold
You don’t let the Devil leave you low
You’re dynamite
And I know you think you might
But don’t leave yourself tonight

(Don’t go back to the party, everybody) thinks they know you
(Don’t go back to the party, put your body) on the line
(Don’t go back to the party, everybody) thinks they know you
(Don’t go back to the party, put your body) on the linе

One in a million and a long way from home
I can hear your poor hеart beating
On the dark end of the phone
I get scared of that
Eh!, tara te tangi a te ruru!

You’re holding on to a feeling long forgotten
By the people all around you
It hurts to fall on frozen ground
I know you, and that day is gonna come
When you’ll be losing
Mm, losing

(Don’t go back to the party, everybody) thinks they know you
(Don’t go back to the party, put somebody) on the line
(Don’t go back to the party, everybody) thinks they know you
(Don’t go back to the party, put somebody) on the linе

Don’t go back to the party
Don’t go back to the party, no

Don’t go back to the party
Don’t go back to the party, no

Don’t go back to the party
Don’t go back to the party, no
