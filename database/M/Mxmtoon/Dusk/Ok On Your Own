I had to go I’m sorry
I hope you’ll understand
That even though it’s over
You know it’s not the end

I couldn’t be your half
Just forming out a whole
I can’t complete you, baby
Find solace in your soul

And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
But your story can not start until you’ve grown
You can find how to be okay on your own
I just can’t be the one that makes you feel at home

I need some time to myself
So I can comprehend
I’m not so scared to admit
I could use a friend

I need some time to myself
To gain some confidence
Another confidant
’Till I can fall again

It’s not that I feel empty
I just want a hand to hold
But now that it’s all over
My life isn’t so cold

It wasn’t meant to be
Maybe we knew that from the start
I can’t complete you, baby
But I’ll hold you in my heart

And I hate to leave you feeling all alone
But your story can not start until you’ve grown
You can find how to be okay on your own
I just can’t be the one that makes you feel at home

I need some time to myself
So I can comprehend
I’m not so scared to admit
I could use a friend

I need some time to myself
To gain some confidence
Another confidant
’Till I can fall again

(I could use a friend)
(Maybe we knew that from the start)
(It wasn’t meant to be)
(I could use a friend)
