I think we saw it coming
It wasn’t hard to see
The time we had together
Was over, we agree

But I have no regrets
Just strange to sit and think
You spend your time with someone else
And then they’re gone within a blink

It’s odd that I can write these songs
Never knowing right from wrong
When I finally found
That my heart could pound
The chapter seemed to end

And I can’t believe you’ve come and gone
When you think your future’s long
There was just no way
Nothing we could say
The chapter has to end

I still know I am thankful
For everything you’ve done
Although it wasn’t easy
I’m proud we gave it a run

The first of many lessons
That I will undergo
Our journeys will diverge here
And we’ll learn from what we know

But it’s odd that I can write these songs
Never knowing right from wrong
When I finally found
That my heart could pound
The chapter seemed to end

And I can’t believe you’ve come and gone
When you think your future’s long
There was just no way
Nothing we could say
The chapter had to end
