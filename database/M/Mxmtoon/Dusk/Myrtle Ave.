The day you came around
I dind’t even notice you
Wearing that ripped t-shirt on Myrtle Avenue

I’ve grown accustomed to
Windows framing clouds up in the atmosphere
Our tiny little world that could just disappear
Outside there’s chaos and confusion can we stay right here?
Stay right here?
Stay right here?

Though everything’s been broken, you’re complete
When everyone’s gone sour, you’re so sweet
You’re so sweet

The list goes on and on
But I keep coming back to you
I check the boxes
But there’s still so much to do
And I keep coming back to you

Windows framing clouds up in the atmosphere
Our tiny little world that could just disappear
Outside there’s chaos and confusion can we stay right here?
Stay right here?
Stay right here?

Though everything’s been broken, you’re complete
Though everyone’s gone sour, you’re so sweet
You’re so sweet

My mind was outta space
It’s so crowded
It’s so crowded

But somehow you erase
All that shattered
Didn’t matter anymore

Though everything’s been broken, you’re complete
Though everyone’s gone sour, you’re so sweet
You’re so sweet
You’re so sweet
