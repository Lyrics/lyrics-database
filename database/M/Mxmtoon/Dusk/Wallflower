Maybe there’s a part of me
That wants to be alone
Maybe there’s a part of me
That’s looking for a home
Searching for a place to be
Don’t want to leave a trace
I’m tryna start my life again
So please forget my face

I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
Live my life in a wallflower garden
With my friends and the fickle heared

I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
No one told me when I started
Now I’m wishing I could hide
And I don’t wanna stand out

I could sit and stay outside
And watch the thunderclouds
Counting on those raindrops
Give me roots into the ground

Never thought I’d be the one
To say there’s something wrong
Can I call and tell you
That I don’t wanna be alone

But I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
Live my life in a wallflower garden
With my friends and the fickle hearted

I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
No one told me when I started
Now I’m wishing I could hide
And I don’t wanna stand out

Why should I go out and change
What I’m supposed to be
I know this song is sad
But you can sing along with me

I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
Live my life in a wallflower garden
With my friends and the fickle hearted

I don’t wanna stand out
I don’t wanna stand out
No one told me when I started
Now I’m wishing I could hide
And I don’t wanna stand out

I don’t wanna stand out

I don’t wanna stand out
