Every passing minute
Is a thought of you not in it
Wishing I could do some nothing
And you could do the same

Every time, the light it changes
The whole city rearranges
I can’t find familiar without you

Even when the sun goes down
Still know my world goes round
Playing Bon Iver on a late night drive
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holding on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down

I still look for pieces
Of home but it decreases
Fading like a t-shirt left to dry out in the sun
There’s too much time to spend alone
Crunching numbers on my phone
Wondering when our stars will meet again

Maybe when the sun goes down
Still know my world goes round
Playing Bon Iver on a late night drive
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holding on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down

Time waits for no one
But there’s beauty in the moments
In the spaces inbetween

Even when the sun goes down
Still know my world goes round
Playing Bon Iver on a late night drive
My window, moon, and fireflies
Holding on to moments that we found
Even when the sun goes down
Even when the sun goes down
