Found myself up here
Suspended in the air
Way too high above
Oh I wanna be down there

Watching people pass
Faces tell a tale
Larger than I’ll know but I’m forging my own path

I’m standing here alone
Just need someone to hold
I’d like it if you could be with me

Oh, just asking for a friend
Someone you’d recommend
Nothing to gain
To just be with me

Just asking for a friend

Just asking for a friend

(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)

And if they came along
I’d be there for them too
’Cause everybody needs
A different point of view

The clouds will come and go
In sunshine and in snow
It’s a universal thing
To want someone you know

I’m standing here alone
Just need someone to hold
I’d like it if you could be with me

Oh, just asking for a friend
Someone you’d recommend
Nothing to gain
To just be with me

Just asking for a friend

Asking for a friend

(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a)

Standing here alone
Just need someone to hold
I’d like it if you could be with me

Oh, just asking for a friend
Someone you’d recommend
Nothing to gain
To just be with me

(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)

Just asking for a friend

(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)

Oh, asking for a friend

(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)
(Just asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)
(Asking for a friend)
