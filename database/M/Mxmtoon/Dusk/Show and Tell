Lately, it’s been getting hard
To find the words
I’m stuck in my brain
I’m going insane
Can somebody help me
Please

And it feels like
I’ve been spinning round and round again
Just want a break
My heart seems to ache
I’m craving some normalcy

’Cause I don’t have much to say
And I’m running out of thoughts to bring today
Show and tell is getting more mundane
No life to live or share
And it all feels so unfair

’Cause we’re
Floating in the air
Our feet are grounded on the earth
But our thoughts are way out there

And we’re having sleepless nights
Losing puzzle pieces for ourselves
We need to feel alright

Somehow I’ve been getting by
All on my own
I’m not gonna lie
It’s harder to try
Waking up each morning
And I’m gazing outside
On my windowsill
The world is so wrong
I hope that we’re strong
But I’m still mourning

’Cause I don’t have much to say
And I’m running out of thoughts to bring today
Show and tell is getting more mundane
No life to live or share
And it all feels so unfair

’Cause we’re
Floating in the air
Our feet are grounded on the earth
But our thoughts are way out there

And we’re having sleepless nights
Losing puzzle pieces for ourselves
We need to feel alright

Floating in the air
Our feet are grounded on the earth
But our thoughts are way out there

And we’re having sleepless nights
Losing puzzle pieces for ourselves
We need to feel alright
