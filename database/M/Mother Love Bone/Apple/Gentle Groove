Like my world, I’m on fire
I am full of desire, yeah
No more preachin’ on your part
No more love on my pillow, yea

Come dance with me in my room
You can hold me hand, ye-ye-ye-yea
I’m gonna be your boyfriend
And you can call me names

Oh, oh, yea

And nothing’s gonna change the way I feel for my love
And no one’s gonna slow my gentle groove
’Til kingdom come thy work is done on earth as it is in Dallas

Come play with me in my room
You can hold me hand, ye-ye-yea
I will be your boyfriend, boyfriend
You can call me names, a na-ha-he-hey

And nobody’s gonna take the power away from my love
And no one’s gonna change the way I feel, no way ye-ye-yey
And no one’s gonna slow my gentle groove
’Til kingdom come thy work is done on earth as it is in Dallas

(C’mon ye)

Oo-hoo-hoo-hoo

Ah-ah

O-ye-ye-ye-ye

This one is for the

Break it down baby
Break it down
Break it down ye

I was a dead man

Yea

Yea

And don’t forget mother

One, two

I was a dead man
