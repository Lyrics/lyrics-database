Ooo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooo, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Chloe don’t know better
Chloe’s just like me (only beautiful)
A couple of years’ difference
But those lessons never learned (did you know?)

Chloe danced the tables in the French Quarter
She’s always been given so I can’t always make her laugh
But I’m proud to say
And I won’t forget
The time spent layin’ by her side
The time spent layin’ by her side
Dreams like this must die
And a dream like this must die
Dream like this must…

You ever heard the story
Of Mr. Faded Glory?
Say, “He who rides the pony must someday fall”

I been talking to my alter
It says, “Life is what you make it
And if you make it, death will rest your soul away, away, away”
Yeah, child

It’s a broken kinda feelin’
Should have to tie me to the ceiling
A bad moon’s-a-comin’
Better say your prayers, child
I wanna tell you that I love you
But does it really matter?
I just can’t stand to see you dragging down again, again,
My baby, again, ye, oh ye

So I’m singin’

And this is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s unkind and leaves me alone, yes it does
And this is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s unkind and leaves me alone

I used to treat you like a lady, now you’re a substitute teacher
This bottle’s not a pretty, not a pretty sight, yea
I owe the man some money, so I’m turnin’ over, honey
You see, Mr. Faded Glory is once again doin’ time, oh yeah

And this is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s unkind and leaves me alone, yes it does, ah
And this is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s unkind and, it’s unkind and it leave me alone, yeah!

Like a crown of thorns, it’s all who you know, yea
So don’t burn your bridges, woman
Cause someday, yeah

Kick it!
Oh, yeah
This is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s unkind and leaves me alone, yea
This is my kinda love
It’s the kind that moves on
It’s the kind that, it’s kind that, yea-yea

Baby!
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, do it
I said oh baby
Don’t burn you bridges, woman
It gonna come back to you
