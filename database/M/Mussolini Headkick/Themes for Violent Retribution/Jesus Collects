I kneel and pray — “you start today”
So I was told — but your book is so old
I hear, I hear him teaching — “follow preaching”
But I… well I can only frown
He’s got me right where he wants me
He’s got me down, down on my knees

Through sightless eyes I saw his lies
I couldn’t accept ..., oh no
...
Your god don’t give
Your god takes it all away

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects all you’ve got
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects all you’ve got

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects… everything

They said, “eat your food up — it’s from God’s earth”
“Go stand in line now” and eat the dirt up
They preached in one tongue, taught us one “belief”
These pictures of perfection — these statues of hypocrisy

They spoke of virtue — of the unspoken word
Don’t question anything — your questions won’t be heard
Chained to an altar of a god we never knew
Forced to confession for things we didn’t do

I kneel and pray…
I kneel and pray…

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects all you’ve got
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects all you’ve got

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes

Ashes to ashes, dust to dust
Jesus collects all you’ve got

Ashes to ash…
