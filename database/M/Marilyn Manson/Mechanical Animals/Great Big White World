In space the stars are no nearer
They just glitter like a morgue
And I dreamed I was a spaceman
Burned like a moth in a flame
And our world was so fucking gone

I’m not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows
I’m not attached to your world
Nothing heals and nothing grows

Because it’s a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescription’s low
I wish you were queen
Just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?

And hell was so cold, all the vases are so broken
And the roses tear our hands all open
Mother Mary miscarry
But we pray just like insects
And the world is so ugly now

Because it’s a great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another
All my stitches itch
My prescription’s low
I wish you were queen
Just for today
All my stitches itch
My prescription’s low
I wish you were queen
Just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?

Great big white world
And we are drained of our colors
We used to love ourselves
We used to love one another

All my stitches itch
My prescription’s low
I wish you were queen
Just for today
All my stitches itch
My prescription’s low
I wish you were queen
Just for today
In a world so white, what else could I say?
