It came without a warning
Under thunderous skies
Now I’m looking for an answer
Ain’t giving up this time
A reason for this distance
And I don’t wanna hear no lies

The storm is getting closer
And there’s a darkness in your eyes
’Cause you love to keep your secrets
But you’re running out of time
Just give me one good reason
And I don’t wanna hear no lies, lies, lies, yea

But hold on just a minute
’Cause there’s a burning in my heart
Scarring my skin
Raging deep within
What have you done to me?
You’re trying to take control
’Cause you’re running out of time, girl
Why don’t you know?

You’re running out of time

You’re running out of time

You’re running out of time, girl
’Cause I’ll leave it all behind
You love to keep your secrets
But don’t leave me wondering why
Just give me one good reason
And I don’t wanna hear no lies, lies, lies!

But hold on just a minute
’Cause there’s a burning in my heart
Scarring my skin
Raging deep within
What have you done to me?
You’re trying to take control
’Cause you’re running out of time, girl
Why don’t you know?

You’re running out of time

You’re running out of time

You’re running out of time

You’re running out of time
