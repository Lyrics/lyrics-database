So much blood, I’m starting to drown
It runs from cold to colder
Time-to-time the skies come down
They help me lose my way

Tears and lies for answers
You and open veins
God knows I’m gone
Girl I just want you to come on down

Lord, it’s a storm, and I’m heading to fall
These sins are mine, and I’ve done wrong
Oh babe, come on down
Come on down, my babe, wrong time I know

Long gone day
Mmm-hm-hmm-hmmm, hmm-mm-hm
Who ever said we wash away with the rain?

See you all from time-to-time
Isn’t it so strange how far away we all are now?
Am I the only one who remembers that summer?
Oh-oh-ooh-oh-oh, I remember
Every day, each time a place was saved
The music that we made
The wind has carried all of that away

Long gone day
Mmm-hm-hmm-hmmm, hmm-mm-hm
Who ever said we wash away with the rain?

So many tears, I’m startin to drown
The rains in heaven must all come down
Silver spoons affix the crown
The luckless ones are broken

Fears and lies for answers
You and open flames
God knows I’m gone
And I just want you to come on down, mmm-hmmm

Lord, it’s a storm, and I’m heading to fall
These sins are mine, and I’ve done wrong
I want you to
Oh, I just want you to come on down

I fear again like then I lost my way, mmm-hm
And shout to God to bring my sunny day, yeah
