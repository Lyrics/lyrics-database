She painted a bullseye on my mind
No matter how I moved, her aim was never high
I guess that was what I needed at the time

A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find

She was heavy on the back beat
She played me just like a tambourine
Well, she took me to church, prayed till it hurt

A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find
I’ll live to love another one more time
A good woman is hard to find

She was a helluva woman, from a helluva town
She took me all the way, it was a long way down
She makes me wonder, wonder, all day long
Can a good woman ever be found?
Can a good woman never be found?

She was beaty and adventure
She seemed so glad to be alive
I want to be happy, but not all the time

A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find
I’ll live to love another one more time
A good woman is hard to find

She wrapped me up, saved me for later
Left me no way to penetrate her
Guess that was what I needed at the time

A good woman is hard to find
A good woman is hard to find
I’ll live to love another one more time
A good woman is hard to find
