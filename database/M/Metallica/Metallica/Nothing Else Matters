So close, no matter how far
Couldn’t be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours - We live it our way
All these words, I don’t just say
And nothing else matters

Trust, I seek; and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
It couldn’t be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

I never opened myself this way
Life is ours - We live it our way
Hey, all these words, I don’t just say
And nothing else matters

Trust, I seek; and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters

Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah-h’eah!

So close, no matter how far
Couldn’t be much more from the heart
Forever, trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
