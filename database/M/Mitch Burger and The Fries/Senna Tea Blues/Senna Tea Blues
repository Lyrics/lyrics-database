I was eatin’ at a restaurant by the sea.
Well, Seth was making mighty strange faces at me.
He clenched his butt cheeks up like an un-shuck clam.
Seth looked me in the face and said, "God damn!"

Old Seth shit all over his brand-new dungarees.
That’s what you get for sippin’ that senna tea.
Cause that ain’t the shit we brew in Tenneesee.
