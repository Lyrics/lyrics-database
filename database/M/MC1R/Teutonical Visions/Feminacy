I’m gonna tell you something you should never tell your spouse.

The reason I’m scared to have kids,
Is all I see when I look at the world is crap.

How am I supposed to bring a kid into this world feeling like that?

I knew when I met the right guy,
He would make me feel safe to have that kid – he would change the way I see things.

On our wedding day,
When I walked down the aisle and I saw you waiting,
I knew you weren’t the guy to make me feel safe to change the way I see things.

You’ll step up – you’re a kid!

How could you say that?
How could you say that to me!?
