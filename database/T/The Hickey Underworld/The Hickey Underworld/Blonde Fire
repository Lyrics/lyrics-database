Don't let me walk out the door (x2)
Don't let me know what it's for (x2)
Don't let me walk out the door (x2)
Don't let me know what it's for (x2)
You look solid

Can't say i'll be there right now 
Can't say i'll be there somehow
Can't say i'll be there right now
And you've been waiting for so long

I got my eyes on you now 
I got my eyes on the prize
I got my eyes on you now
And i've been waiting for so long

The lies they to are scared of you
The way we are right from the start
Yeah you owe me (x2)
I don't do you to call that's true
Off you to fall to rip from the love
Yeah you owe me (x2)

Don't let me walk out the door (x2)
Don't let me know what it's for (x2)
Cause i've been waiting for so long

I don't do you to call that's true
Off you to fall to rip from the love
Yeah you owe me (x2)

A calf an are why do you stare
The life the love down from above
Yeah you owe me (x6)

And ties are prize
And my ally
And ties are prize
And my ally for you
