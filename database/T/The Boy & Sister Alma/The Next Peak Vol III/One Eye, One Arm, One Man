Black lights’ time
...
One eye, one arm, one man
...

Come, pray
...
One shot, one taste, dream on
Dream my dream away

You’ve got the same
Beautiful face
You speak to me in red
You speak to me in red

You speak to me in red

You speak to me in red

One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One shot, one taste, dream on
Dream my dream away

One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One shot, one taste, dream on
Dream my dream away

... with me
... you
secrets
(...)
There are times
Up and below
We need to bring back the time

One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One shot, one taste, dream on
Dream my dream away

One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One eye, one arm, one man, I’ll take it all
One shot, one taste, dream on
Dream my dream away
