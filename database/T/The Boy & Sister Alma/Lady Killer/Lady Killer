Each cut a phase from boy to man, a growing pain
From milk to meat neglect the soul, take everything
Heaven doesn’t know you, you’ve fallen down
The ones that once adored you fear your sound

She’s a cold piece of meat you’ll bleed her out
Devour each piece you’ll take her down
She’s only a feast, her love is real, she’s only a feast

Only in a high moon do you expose yourself
Show your teeth, your wild moves, you’re an animal
When that beast consumes you, you come straight from hell

Lady killer, lady killer
A wolf
Lady killer, lady killer
A wolf
Lady killer, lady killer

The birth of lust it leaves a trail, each story topped by a woman’s veil
And all is lost when he sinks in to steal your touch, your tender skin
The course obscures, a delightful smile sweeps the corner of the beast's profile
You gave him your love, you gave him your grace
He took for granted every moment but seeing your lifeless face

You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart

A Wolf
Lady killer, lady killer
A wolf
Lady killer, lady killer
A wolf
Lady killer, lady killer

The birth of lust it leaves a trail, each story topped by a woman’s veil
And all is lost when he sinks in to steal your touch, your tender skin
The course obscures, a delightful smile sweeps the corner of the beast's profile
You gave him your love, you gave him your grace
He took for granted every moment but seeing your lifeless face

You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
You fell for him hard, you got a broken heart
