Ooo-ooo-ooh…

Crash,
the thunderous moan.
Thrash,
and rattle the bones.

Alone…

Down below,
the monster is home.

Let it reel and rile.
Red and green as the bile.
Quell the qualm,
Overwrought, it fought.

Down below,
the monster is home.
Let it show,
it takes one to know.

Sinking deeper than deep,
lost in fangs and teeth,
now sleep.

Down below,
the monster is home.
Let it show,
it takes one to know.

The monster is home…

Ooo-ooo-ooh…
