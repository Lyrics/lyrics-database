I see you’ve found my underground
Help yourself to guns and ammo
Nothing here has ever seen
The light of day
I leave it in my head

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

(You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life
You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life)

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

(Don’t fuck it up
Don’t fuck it up
Don’t fuck it up)

(You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life
You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life)

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

(Don’t fuck it up
Don’t fuck it up
Don’t fuck it up)

(You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life
You’ll remember me
For the rest of your life)

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life
It’s the first day of the rest of your life

(For the rest of your life)
