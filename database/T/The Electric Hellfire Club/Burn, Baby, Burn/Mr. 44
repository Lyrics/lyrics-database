(I like girls a lot, I like pretty girls, I only shoot pretty girls)

[God damn you, pig]

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)
[That’s what I’m saying]
(Sun is the devil)
[That’s what I’m saying]

Greetings from the gutter where the red, red rivers run
I bring you sweet salvation from the barrel of a gun
Is she a virgin or is she a whore?
I don’t really give a damn
I’m Mr. 44!

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)
[That’s what I’m saying]
(Sun is the devil)
[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)
(Sun is the devil)

I’m a bottomless pit with nothing in it
A void filled with unclean spirits
A hound of Hell on a long, long leash
Can you count the number of this beast?

Mr. 44

Every time I pull my trigger the Devil’s work is done
Hellfire and damnation from the barrel of a gun
22 disciples of Hell knocking at death’s door
To each his own, but make mine murder
I’m Mr. 44!

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)

[That’s what I’m saying]
(Mr. 44)

(Mr. 44)
