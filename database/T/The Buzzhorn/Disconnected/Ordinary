Friends, the fun, the cigarettes, and the sun came out today
And they're waiting for the turn of your back
Lies, deceit, the dirty looks, and some things they like to say
It’s the curve that made your confidence crack

This is your life, it’s all been ordinary
Until you find all you’re worth
Then you find your life is all but something ordinary
And you’re longing for home
You're gonna find yourself at home

Bags that hang below your eyes
And the full-length mirror never lies
And it all comes so disgustingly clear

But you stand up straight now start to try
And it cleans up right in a suit and tie
But your money is no good around here

This is your life, it’s all been ordinary
Until you find all you’re worth
Then you find your life is all but something ordinary
And you’re longing for home
You're gonna find yourself at home

At home, yeah
Find yourself at home
At home, whoa-whoah

Life and death, the money that’s left
And the vultures dive to intercept
And the friendship rolls onto its side
And you wait for it really to die

This is your life, it’s all been ordinary
Until you find all you’re worth
Then you find your life is all but something ordinary
And you’re longing for home
You're gonna find yourself at home

Oh no
You're gonna find yourself at home
You're gonna find yourself at…
You're gonna find yourself at home
Oh no
You're gonna find yourself at home
