(Your face is burned inside my brain)
I lost my way
(Your taste of stale flows through my veins)
The cost of hate

(’Cause you’ll never understand me…)
You want me to stay!

You’re ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can’t hear you — I’m not listening anymore
You’re subject to falling
But I can’t save you — I don’t see you anymore

(The race of slowing down the pain…)
I found a way
(The pace of speaking so mundane…)
The sound of gain

(But you’ll never make me happy…)
So I’ve extinguished the flame

You’re ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can’t hear you — I’m not listening anymore
You’re subject to falling
But I can’t save you — I don’t see you anymore

And what you want me to say
I’ll never say
You’re playing the game
That I’ll never play

So what do you want from me?
Now I’ve extinguished the flame

Your ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can’t hear you — I’m not listening anymore
You’re subject to falling
But I can’t save you — I don’t see you anymore

You’re ca-ca-ca-calling
But I can’t hear you — I’m not listening anymore
You’re fa-fa-fa-falling
But I can’t save you — I don’t see you anymore
