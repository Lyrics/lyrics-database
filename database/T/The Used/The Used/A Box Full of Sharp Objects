It’s our time to shine through the down
Glorified by what is ours
We’ve fallen in love
We’ve fallen in love
It was the best idea I ever had

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful thing

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful thing

Sick

Do you want a song of glory?
Well, I’m fucking screaming at you

It’s our time to shine through the down
Glorified by what is ours
We’ve fallen in love
We’ve fallen in love
It was the best idea I ever had

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful

Today I fell and felt better
Just knowing this matters
I just feel stronger and sharper
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful
Found a box of sharp objects
What a beautiful thing
