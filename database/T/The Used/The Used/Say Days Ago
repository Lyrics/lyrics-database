I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I think that I’m happier now
Up from the down
By all means
It’s strange ’cause I feel the same way

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like

Same strange
Said it’s strange cause I feel the same

Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like

Makes me ill

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes, taste

Same strange
Said it’s strange cause I feel the same

Same strange
Said it’s strange cause I feel the same

Same strange
Said it’s strange cause I feel the same

Same strange
Said it’s strange cause I feel the same

Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like
