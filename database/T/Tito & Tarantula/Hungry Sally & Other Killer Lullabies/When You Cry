You’re safe, reborn
I can see your passionate horns
Now I know that you don’t regret
What you’re doin’ to me, what you’re doin’ to me

In the fight, pulling out
When the thunder brings you down
You won’t leave me, you won’t leave me
You won’t leave me hanging around

When you cry it’s like a butterfly
When you cry it’s like a butterfly
In my heart

So, you’re right
I heard you through the window
Last night
You been shaking like a leaf on a tree in winter

Pulling out, you’re in love
Got a heinous storm coming
You won’t see me, you won’t see me
You won’t see me again

When you cry it’s like a butterfly
When you cry it’s like a butterfly
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart

You let me love you
In your naughty gaudy charm
The storm in your face, it’s come a long way
Your two bare feet are mistaken, maybe

What was taken, what was added
What was dropped, and what was shattered
There’s nothing you could do
You know nothing would be done

When you cry it’s like a butterfly
When you cry it’s like a butterfly
When you cry it’s like a butterfly
When you cry it’s like a butterfly
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart
In my heart
