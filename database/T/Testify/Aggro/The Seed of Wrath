You ask why you scream and wake up from dreams that are not of the kind
You like
you ask what is this that you’ve lost the bliss that you once derived
From life

I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer

Before more crap stuff happens
Before more jerks will hurt
Before more freaks wreck patterns
Before more pride is blurred

It might be better to know how to fight
It might be better to change the style

And the weakness must pass and nothingness die and due action take over
time to name the price
Before more will fall apart the torn soul roars

The seed of wrath was spilled once
The seed of wrath will be spilled again
The seed of wrath will once bloom
The seed of wrath will bear fruit

Before more sick must happen
Before more ’s not at ease
Before more sick shit happens
Before less minds have peace

It might be better to name the price
