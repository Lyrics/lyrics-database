You ask why you scream, and wake up from dreams
That are not of the kind you like
You ask what is this, that you’ve lost the bliss
That you once derived from life

I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer

It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
Is burns your mind away!

You ask why the heck do we feel like wrecks
We walk around like hollow shapes
You’ve come to ask yourself, “Why do we raise this hell,
Why do I feel like I was raped?”

I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer
I know the answer

It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
Is burns!
It burns!
It burns!
It burns!

It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It burns!
It burns!
It burns!
It burns!

It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
It is anger that is burning you, it is burning you, it is burning you
Is burns your mind away!
