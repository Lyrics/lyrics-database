Red alert, the roar, the footmen riot
War for more, to gain what was denied
Wrath and blood, the scheme needs to be rectified
Urban endfight, urban endfight!

Junked, they tilt, they kneel, they fall down, how it roars, it roars
World that turns with graceless motion ’round a wasted sun
How to stop this joyless stumbling thru disposal fun?

What they need’s to feel kind of alike
They want more than trash, than useless toys
Urban endfight, the creeps of low life!

Cries for rights, for lives without restraint arise
With uncertain circulation wheeling ’round the prey
Suburban guerilla against the life that’s lived in vain

World so full, so rich with madness
Men they burn with hate against this
Circling with their graceless motion ’round a grinning sun
Second class inferior members of mankind, the witless one!
