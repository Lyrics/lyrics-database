My woman is dumb as shit
I’m not gonna pretend

Yes, my woman is dumb as shit
Ain’t no good for me to pretend
One day, she’ll tell you a story
And the next day, you’ll pray it will end

She takes selfies with her dinner
When I take her out to town
If I don’t like them on Facebook
All night she’ll fix me with a frown

Yes, my woman is dumb as shit
I’m not gonna pretend
One day she filmed me for TikTok
And the next day, was mad I didn’t trend

She called her baby Genesis
‘Cause she’d wanted a Biblical name
But fell asleep reading page two
I guess her dumb ex is also to blame

Yes, my woman is dumb as shit
I’m not gonna pretend
One day, she’ll laugh at my farts
And the next day, their smell will offend

Hell, my woman is dumb as shit
There’s no more need for me to lie
One day, I’ll squeeze her titties for the last time
And the next day, I’ll tell them goodbye
