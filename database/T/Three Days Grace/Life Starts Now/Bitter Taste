Just let me say one thing; I’ve had enough
You’re selfish and sorry, you’ll never learn how to love
As your world disassembles, better keep your head up

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced; you’ve been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I’ve wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste of you

Just let me clear my head, I think I’ve had too much
You’re so disappointing but you make good use of it
As your world disassembles, better keep your head up

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Betrayed, disgraced; you’ve been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I’ve wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste of you

Your name, your face is all you have left now
Disgraced, betrayed; you’ve been erased

So long, so long, I have erased you
So long, so long, I’ve wanted to waste you
So long, so long, I have erased you
I have escaped the bitter taste
I have escaped the bitter taste of you
