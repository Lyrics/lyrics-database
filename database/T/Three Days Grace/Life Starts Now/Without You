What if I walked without you?
What if I ran without you?
What if I stand without you?
I could not go on

What if I lived without you?
What if I loved without you?
What if I died without you?
I could not go on

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don’t feel right
But I, I can’t let you out of sight
Without you I’m no one, I’m nothing at all

What if I lie without you?
And what if I rise without you?
And what if I dream without you?
I could not go on, no

You left my side tonight
And I, I just don’t feel right
But I, I can’t let you out of sight
Without you, I’m no one, I’m nothing at all

You left my side tonight
And I just don’t feel right
I can’t let you out of sight
Without you, I’m no one, I’m nothing at all

You left my side tonight (My side tonight)
And I, I just don’t feel right (Don’t feel right)
But I, I can’t let you out of sight
Without you, I’m no one, I’m nothing at all

Nothing at all
