I’ll be coming home just to be alone
’Cause I know you’re not there and I know that you don’t care
I can hardly wait to leave this place

No matter how hard I try you’re never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear even when you’re here
This is not my home, I think I’m better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

By the time you come home I’m already stoned
You turn off the TV and you scream at me
I can hardly wait till you get off my case

No matter how hard I try you’re never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear even when you’re here
This is not my home, I think I’m better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home

I’m better off alone

No matter how hard I try you’re never satisfied
This is not a home, I think I’m better off alone
You always disappear even when you’re here
This is not my home, I think I’m better off alone

Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a
Home, home, this house is not a home
