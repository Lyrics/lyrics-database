Tonight my head is spinning
I need something to pick me up
I’ve tried, but nothing is working
I won’t stop, I won’t say I’ve had enough

Tonight, I start the fire
Tonight, I break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

At night I feel like a vampire
It’s not right but I just can’t give it up
I’ll try to get myself higher
Let’s go, we’re gonna light it up

Tonight, we start the fire
Tonight, we break away

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

Break away from everybody
Break away from everything
If you can’t stand the way this place is
Take yourself to higher places

Higher places
To higher places
Higher places
Take yourself to higher places
