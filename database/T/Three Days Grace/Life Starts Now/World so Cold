I’d never thought I’d feel this
Guilty and I’m broken down inside
Livin’ with myself, nothing but lies
I always thought I’d make it
But never knew I’d let it get so bad
Livin’ with myself is all I have

I feel numb, I can’t come to life
I feel like I’m frozen in time

Livin’ in a world so cold, wastin’ away
Livin’ in a shell with no soul since you’ve gone away
Livin’ in a world so cold, countin’ the days
Since you’ve gone away, you’ve gone away

Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside?
Staring at yourself, paralyzed

I feel numb, I can’t come to life
I feel like I’m frozen in time

Livin’ in a world so cold, wastin’ away
Livin’ in a shell with no soul since you’ve gone away
Livin’ in a world so cold, countin’ the days
Since you’ve gone away, you’ve gone away

I’m too young (Too young) to lose my soul
I’m too young (Too young) to feel this old
So long (So long), I’m left behind
I feel like I’m losin’ my mind

Do you ever feel me?
Do you ever look deep down inside?
Staring at your life, paralyzed

Livin’ in a world so cold, wastin’ away
Livin’ in a shell with no soul since you’ve gone away
Livin’ in a world so cold, countin’ the days
Since you’ve gone away, you’ve gone away from me

I’m too young (Too young)
I’m too young (Too young)
