Well, love’s a beautiful thing as long as it’s for real
The way it makes you dream, the way it makes you feel
Well, there’s a lady I know who plays a game from the start
It’s got something to do with her cold-cold heart

I know she’ll treat me mean
’Cause that’s what I’ve seen
Hey, hey, hey
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart

It’s the way you walk, it’s the way you talk
It’s the clothes you wear and that sun in your hair
I found you irresistible right from the start
It had something to do with your cold-cold heart

I know you’ll treat me mean
’Cause that’s what I’ve seen
Hey, hey, hey
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
You got a cold-cold heart, yeah!

This love it sure ain’t real boy, I wish she could feel
It’s like a poison dart shot straight through your heart
Can’t stay away from this girl — if you know what I mean
She’s like no other girl, no one ever seen

I know shel’ll treat me mean
That’s what I’ve seen
Hey, hey, hey
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
You got a cold-cold heart
So cold, baby!

Let me spell it out using a word or two
How my old heart has been affected by you
I’m sittin’ on cloud nine, but it sure feels fine
That’s where I seem to be everytime you’re wih me

I know you’ll treat me mean
That’s what I’ve seen
Hey, hey, hey
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
Cold-cold heart
You got a cold-cold heart
