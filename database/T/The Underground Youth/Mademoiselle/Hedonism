Come, my poor heart, come
Old friend, true and tried
Lies before the chasm
Gaping wide

With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries
With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries

What the hell are you doing here, what else can I say?
I lied to you with every hour, every hour of every day
Now, why canâ€™t we be like you, just fuck our pain away?

Is that the sun coming down
Threatening to break?
Or just the part of you
That I could never take?

With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries
With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries
With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries

With long sobs, the violin throbs, and cries
