Alone
To live with my own thoughts
The burning, it won’t stop
The air is all gone
I’m falling and can’t stop
The end is on my mind
The end is all right

The only chance I’ve got
Forever in my mind
Before I leave my side
Running out of time
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind

The only chance I’ve got
Forever in my mind
Before I leave my side
Running out of time
Alone
Alone
Alone

The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
The end is on my mind
