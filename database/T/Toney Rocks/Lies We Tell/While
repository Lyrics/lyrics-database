Time keeps dripping down the drain
While they drive your head insane
They don’t have to speak
’Cause you know what they’re saying

While you let them push you around

Now they’re watching what you say
Just so they can lie away
You don’t have to stay
’Cause you know what they’re doing

While you let them push you around

You’ve been beating up yourself
Taking blame ’cause they up and left
Sold you on a dream
But didn’t really mean it

While you let them push you around

While you let them push you around

You’ve been taking back yourself
Replacing what fell off the shelf
Now you’re running free
But don’t you fuck around and blow it

While you let them push you around

While you let them push you around
