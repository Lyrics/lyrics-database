Time keeps dripping
Down the drain
While they drive your
Head insane

They don’t have to spaek
’Cause you know what they’d say
While you let them
Push you around

Now they’re watching
What you say
Just so that they can
Lie away

You don’t have to stay
’Cause you don’t want to do it
While you let them
Push you around

You’ve keep eating
Up yourself
Taking blame
’Cause they’ve up and left

Sold you ...
... didn’t really mean it
While you let them
Push you around

While you let them
Push you around

You’ve been taking
Back yourself
Replacing what ...
... off the shelf

Now you’re running free
But don’t you ...
While you let them
Push you around

While you let them
Push you around
