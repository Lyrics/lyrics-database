We’re from a long line of people running from themselves.
Let’s look alive. The sun is blocked out from sight. All days turn to night.
I’m done running from myself. I speak for no one else. No.
Everyday in succession. Until we come undone. Nah.

This is me. This is you.
Yeah, we’re coming unglued.
Like a page pulled from the bind.

I can’t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn’t matter where I’ve been. Can’t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it’s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

What you see is what they want you to see.
You’ve got to learn that for yourself and not from me.
Lessons learned in a lifetime. Sleep with an open eye. What’s yours ain’t mine.
No matter what we’re gonna pull through. Just like we always do. Yeah, ain’t that the truth.

This is me. This is you.
Riding on a fault line.
Yeah, as we divide.

I can’t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn’t matter where I’ve been. Can’t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it’s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

Once more into the fray.
Once more doing what’s expected of me until it ends.
It ends as it begun. Then our work is done…;
