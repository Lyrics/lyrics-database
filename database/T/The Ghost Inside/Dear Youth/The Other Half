We believe in a system that has long been broken.
We turn the other cheek without a glimpse of emotion.
Always looking out for number one. Why do you need more while others have none?

Measure my worth by what I’ve done, not what I’ve become.

I spanned the oceans. I’ve seen the skies. That’s all I’m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren’t even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn’t mean that you need.

We’ve come so far from the lives that we’re meant to live.
But there’s so much more that I have left to give.
We always borrow time that can’t be given back.
We let it slip away and never pick up the slack.

I spanned the oceans. I’ve seen the skies. That’s all I’m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life, aren’t even things at all.
Nothing that drives my soul is even tangible.
Just because you want, doesn’t mean that you need.

Force fed and misled. Now we hang by a thread.
Force fed and misled. But not me, I see red.

You need to hear this.
Measure my worth by what I’ve done, not what I’ve become.
Are you listening?
Measure my worth by what I’ve done, not what I’ve become.

I’ve spanned the oceans. I’ve seen the skies. That’s all I’m ever gonna need to get by.
My favorite things in life aren’t even things at all.
But they’re the things that keep my heart full.
