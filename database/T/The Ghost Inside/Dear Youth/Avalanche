I can’t stop screaming these words over again.
Until breath escapes and my chest caves in.
It doesn’t matter where I’ve been. Can’t give in, and shut down.
Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.
I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.
And now it’s time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.

I’ve been here one time, two times, now three times before.
Long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door.
I’m staring at the face of doubt so I can’t forget who I’m cutting out.
Why put in my all just to watch my buildings fall?

Hey, hey, I’m living for today.
Forgetting things I can’t change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

It all comes down to this. Both truth and consequence.
I need something more than an empty promise.
To believe in something, just one thing, that will never go wrong, not today.
Letdown after letdown, I’m done.

Hey, hey, I’m living for today.
Forgetting things I can’t change unwinds me.
Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.
Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.

Count the clock till the overhaul.
You built a bomb inside my walls.
Count the clock till we’re out of hand.
You build, build now we’re caught in the avalanche.

Reset, rebuild. You wrecked this city but not my will.
