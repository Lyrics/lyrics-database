This will not be the new revival or a claim to fame.
Far away from the slings and arrows is where you go to pass your blame.
It’s the ones with no courage that can’t face the day.
A captain with no ship is just a castaway.

I sent my heart out to sea. I sent out my everything.

A crown atop your head does not make you a king.
A crowd that follows does not mean you can lead.
Take this for what it is. We all know who’s to blame.
You’re not going to find your place.
You’re just a face with no name.

The weak prey on the weak, and I’ll be the first to say.
That I don’t have all of the answers.
Sometimes I run away.
But I set out on this course, continue with no remorse.
I know who I am, and it’s enough for me.

I sent my heart out to sea. I sent out my everything.

A crown atop your head does not make you a king.
A crowd that follows does not mean you can lead.
Take this for what it is. We all know who’s to blame.
You’re not going to find your place.
You’re just a face with no name.

I sent my heart straight out sea. Will it make its way back to me?

I’ve been so lost because all I’ve found is hatred and corruption.
Can my heart weather this storm?
And through the cold stay warm? I said!
If it makes its way back to me. I can survive anything.
