Grab ahold of me, I’ve got my arms up.
Pull me out from this darkness.
It’s so hard for me to see so light up the end of that tunnel.

If it’s a war you came to see you will never see a waved white flag in front me.
I can’t end up dead, I won’t be misled. I’ll keep singing this song inside my head.

A phoenix rise? Or your demise?
Do I have to put your name on this grave? Or give you one more shot?
This addiction came like a freight train, oh!
You’re coming off of the rails again.
It’s hard for you to see the light at the end of the tunnel.

If it’s a war you came to see you will never see a waved white flag in front me.
I can’t end up dead, I won’t be misled. I’ll keep singing this song inside my head.

If it’s a war you came to see you will never see a waved white flag in front me.
I can’t end up dead, I won’t be misled. I’ll keep singing this song inside my head.

On a one way course set for destruction, full speed ahead.
The time has come for you to start things over.
Hold on, full speed ahead.

All my life I’ve been waiting for something, that never came.
It never came. But I’m still saying.
All my life I’ve been searching for something,
To break these chains.
To break these chains.
But I’ll keep swinging.

All my life I’ve been waiting for something, that never came.
It never came. But I’m still saying.
All my life I’ve been searching for something,
To break these chains.
To break these chains.
But I’ll keep swinging.

All my life I’ve been waiting for something, for something, that never came.
It never came. But I’m still saying.
All my life I’ve been searching for something, for something,
To break these chains.
To break these chains.
But I’ll keep swinging.
All my life I’ve been waiting for something, that never came.
It never came. But I’m still saying.
All my life I’ve been searching for something,
To break these chains.
To break these chains.
But I’ll keep swinging.
