I could tell you what you want to hear to hold you off another year.
But I hope the truth finds you well.
A common praise. A passing phase.
Moving forward? Not today!
The limit’s in the sky, but will you be reaching it tonight?

Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
"I’m alive!" Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,
"I’m alive, and I’m not going anywhere!"

No chance to be free. No chance to soar in the sky.
Your feet fixed to the ground.
Desperation is what’s weighing you down.
Whether my strength be heaven sent or my own self-confidence.
These days when I’m walking through a crowd.
I don’t have to hold my head down.

No more wasting time. Burn bright like a star, ignite.
The limit’s in the sky but will you be reaching it tonight?

Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.
“I’m alive!” Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.
Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,
“I’m alive, and I’m not going anywhere!”

“Be a leader and never ever follow”
That’s what my father, that’s what he always told me.
So with those words boldly spoken, he sent me down a long and hard road.

Shrug it off my shoulders, it was never meant for me.
I won’t waste my time in mediocrity.

Tonight I’m alive.
