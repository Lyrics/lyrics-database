Well, it’s reality
Break down the game
It’s come to life
But the program’s been changed
It’s now evolving
To a life you once knew
Something’s gone wrong
Now the enemy is you

Beat the machine
Let the circuits burn
Let the games begin
And the bodies burn
Break down the game
You see, you’ve got to burn

It’s all over
Moving to level 2
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready
It’s all over
Moving to level 3
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready
It’s all over
Moving to level 4
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready

Like an illusion
Unlike a dream
You don’t wake up
Got to fight ’til you win
Keep on playing
’Cause the joke is on you
You might be sorry
But the game is through

Well, it’s reality
Break down the game
It’s come to life
But the program’s been changed
It’s now evolving
To a life you once knew
Something’s gone wrong
Now the enemy is you

Beat the machine
Let the circuits burn
Let the games begin
And the bodies burn
Break down the game
You see, you’ve got to burn

It’s all over
Moving to level 2
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready
It’s all over
Moving to level 3
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready
It’s all over
Moving to level 4
Do you want to play?
Evolver ready

Like an illusion
Unlike a dream
You don’t wake up
Got to fight ’til you win
Keep on playing
’Cause the joke is on you
You might be sorry
But the game is through

Beat the machine
Let the circuits burn
Let the games…
