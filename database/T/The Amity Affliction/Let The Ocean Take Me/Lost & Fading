So young, heartbroken, daydreaming, lost focus
Weaker than you've ever been
Counting on a fading dream
The ocean gleaming emerald green
The saddest thing you've ever seen
Your feet stuck in the sinking sand
Your mind is reeling, shaky hands
Tears are streaming, sorrow calls
With no one there to break your fall

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound

So fucking young, heartbroken, daydreaming, lost focus
A weary soul, no truth to find
They were so lost where was your goodbye?
Your feet stuck in the sinking sand
Your mind is reeling, shaky hands
Tears are streaming, sorrow calls
With no one there to break your fall

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound

You've searched your soul for far too long
Your friend was lost, you carry on
You bear the burden of sorrow's past
But you were built, you were built to fucking last
You were built to last
I'm fading fast, out in the cold unknown
All sorrow here, so far from home
So far from home

I'm lost and fading, life ain't great
My heart is breaking and life won't wait
There's no one there, no one around
There's not a soul and not a sound
No one around and not a sound
