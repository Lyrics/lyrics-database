This is my open letter, this is something to remember.
I won’t be buried before my time,
I’m not searching for forever,
I’ve got my eyes opened wide,
I’ve been searching under rubble from the past,
just looking for a reason to make your life last.
No need to look skyward for you to find hope,
no need for redemption to be saved from the rope,

Fuck No!

I’m not searching the sky for a reason to live
’cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give.
So let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears,
let me give you my life, let me give you my fears.

Just so you can hold on and sing while I do, sing these words out so loud,
like I sing them for you.
This is your open letter, something to remember,
we can still keep on fighting even though life is not forever.

I’m not searching the sky for a reason to live
’cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give,
so let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears,
let me give you my life, let me give you my fears.

This is my open letter, this is something to remember.
This is my open letter, I’m not searching for forever.

I’m not searching the sky for a reason to live
’cause I found beauty right here and the passion to give,
so let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears,
let me give you my life, let me give you my fears.

One… more… time!

I’m not searching the sky for a reason to live
’cause I found beauty right here and found the passion to give,
so let me give you my heart, let me give you my tears,
let me give you my life, let me give you my fears.
