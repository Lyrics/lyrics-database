It was long ago
It seems like yesterday
Saw you standing in the rain
Then I heard you say

I want to love, but it comes out wrong
I want to live, but I don’t belong
I close my eyes and I see
Blood and roses

Wild flowers in the springtime
October we were wed
In winter time the roses died
Her blood ran cold and then she said

I want to love, but it comes out wrong
I want to live, but I don’t belong
I close my eyes and I see
Blood and roses

It was long ago
It seems like yesterday
I saw you standing in the rain
Then I heard you say

I need your love, but it comes out wrong
I tried to live, but I don’t belong
I close my eyes and I see
Blood and roses

Blood and roses (roses, roses, roses)
Blood and roses (roses, roses)
Blood and roses (roses, roses)
