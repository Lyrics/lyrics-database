No matter how many times that you told me you wanted to leave
No matter how many breaths that you took you still couldn’t breathe
No matter how many nights that you’d lie wide awake to the sound of the poison rain

Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

As days go by the night’s on fire

Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you’re right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane’s chasing us all underground

No matter how many deaths that I die, I will never forget
No matter how many lives that I live, I will never regret
There is a fire inside of this heart and a riot about to explode into flames

Where is your God?
Where is your God?
Where is your God?

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?

Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you’re right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane’s chasing us all underground

The promises we made were not enough
The prayers that we had prayed were like a drug
The secrets that we sold were never known
The love we had, the love we had, we had to let it go

Tell me would you kill to save a life?
Tell me would you kill to prove you’re right?
Crash, crash, burn let it all burn
This hurricane’s chasing us all underground

Oh, oh, oh (This hurricane)
Oh, oh, oh (This hurricane)
Oh, oh, oh (This hurricane)
Oh, oh, oh (This hurricane)

Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to torture for my sins?
Do you really want?
Do you really want me?
Do you really want me dead or alive to live a lie?

Running away from the light
Running away from the light
