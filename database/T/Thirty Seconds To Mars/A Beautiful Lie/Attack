I won’t suffer, be broken, get tired, or wasted
Surrender to nothing, or give up what I
Started and stopped it, from end to beginning
A new day is coming, and I am finally free

Run away, run away, I’ll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I’ll attack
I’ll attack, I’ll a-
WHOAAAA

I would’ve kept you forever, but we had to sever
It ended for both of us, faster than a
Kill off this thinking, it’s starting to sink in
I’m losing control now, but without you I can finally see

Run away, run away, I’ll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I’ll attack
I’ll attack, I’ll a-
WHOAAAA

Your promises, they look like lies
Your honesty, like a back that hides a knife
I promise you (promise you), I promise you (promise you)
That I am finally free

Run away, run away, I’ll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I’ll attack
I’ll attack, I’ll attack, I will attack

Run away, run away (I’ll attack), I will attack
Run away, run away (I’ll attack), I will attack
Run away (I’ll attack), run away now, I’ll attack
I’ll attack, I’ll a-
WHOAAAA

Your promises

I promise you
I promise you
