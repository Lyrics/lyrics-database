Is there something that you are trying to say
Don’t hold back now
It’s been a long time since I felt this way
So don’t hold back now

I purposely forgot about
Loving anyone
’Cause I’m the only one who has
Who has been stepped upon

Is there something that you are trying to say
’Cause I can take it
’Cause I grew up a man this way
When I’m hurt I shake it

I’ll crawl back into my cave
That’s how I’ll make it
’Cause out of all this hurt we have
Beauty thus become, beauty thus become

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

Wishing all the best for you
And now I’ll say goodbye
’Cause all the shit that we’ve been through
Put wisdom in my eyes

So walk away, don’t turn around
’Cause I won’t be standing here
’Cause all the lies that I’ve been living through
Are becoming very clear

And beauty thus become, oh yea-yeah

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside (inside)
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

Then you conned me into thinking
That all I had was you
The small insinuations
Were cutting me through, cutting me through

And now I stand alone here
Stronger than before
And I’ll never go back
Never go back, never go

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide (trying to hide)

In the mourning I can see the sights
No wonder I could never keep you satisfied (satisfied)
In the mourning I can see inside
Myself and all the things that you were trying to hide
