London calling
To the far away towns
Now war is declared
And battle come down

London calling
To the underworld
Come out of the cupboard
You boys and girls

London calling
Now don’t look to us
Phony Beatlemania
Has bitten the dust

London calling
See we ain’t got no swing
Except for the ring
Of that truncheon thing

The ice age is coming
The sun’s zooming in
Meltdown expected
And the wheat is growing thin

Engines stop running
But I have no fear
’Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

London calling
To the imitation zone
Forget it brother
You can go it alone

London calling
To the zombies of death
Quit holding out
And draw another breath

London calling
And I don’t wanna shout
But while we were talking
I saw you nodding out

London calling
See we ain’t got no highs
Except for that one
With the yellowy eyes

The ice age is coming
The sun’s zooming in
Engines stop running
And the wheat is growing thin

A nuclear error
But I have no fear
’Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

The ice age is coming
The sun’s zooming in
Engines stop running
And the wheat is growing thin

A nuclear error
But I have no fear
’Cause London is drowning and I
Live by the river

Now get this…

London calling
Yeah I was there too
And you know what they said?
Well some of it was true

London calling
At the top of the dial
And after all this
Won’t you give me a smile?

London calling

I never felt so much a-like…
