You can see her whenever it rains
From Rome to New Orleans, dancing on the graves
Burdened by the heart, she loves her sunglasses after dark
And every single day her little life falls apart

She’s out to look
So macabre and alone
She’s close to hook
On her dying

Just like a gothic girl
Lost in the darkened world
My little gothic girl
Darker side jewel, are your razor cuts for real, baby?

(Yeah)

You can see she’s on her road to ruin
Stigmata from crucifixion on her pale white skin
Tribal pagan art, she loves her tattooed Egyptian mark
And every single day her love will tear us apart

She’s out to look
So macabre and alone
She’s close to hook
On her dying

Just like a gothic girl
Lost in the darkened world
My little gothic girl
Always so dramatic, Christ, I want you

Gothic girl
Lost in the darkened world
My little gothic girl
Darker side jewel, are your razor cuts for real, baby?

My little gothic girl
Lost in the darkened world
My little gothic girl
Always so dramatic, Christ, I want you

Gothic girl
Lost in the darkened world
My little gothic girl
Darker side jewel, are your razor cuts for real, baby?
