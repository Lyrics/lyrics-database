Said you wanted to feel
Cold metal and hard steel
But it cuts in too deep
To see you doing your midnight creep

Somebody hurts you, so you’re hurting me
The only way it was meant to be
As the lights of neon slowly dim
I can read in flesh everywhere you’ve been

Dreaming of silence
Of the gentle rain
Sleeping with lions
In the temple of pain

Said you wanted to steal
A heart of soul and make a deal
With the danger that you feed
Don’t like the monsters that you keep

Somebody hurts you, so you’re hurting me
The only way it was meant to be
As the lights of neon slowly dim
I can read in flesh everywhere you’ve been

Dreaming of silence
Of the gentle rain
Sleeping with lions
In the temple of pain

Dreaming of silence
Of the gentle rain
Sleeping with lions
In the temple of pain

Dreaming of silence
Of the gentle rain
Sleeping with lions
In the temple of pain
