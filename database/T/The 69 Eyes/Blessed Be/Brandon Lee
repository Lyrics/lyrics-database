What would there be
As the river of sadness turns into sea?
Could there be
Another thousand stories like you and me?

Wanted a heart, wanted a soul
More than anything else in this world
But we are doomed, our flesh and wounds
I would never give in

Just like the moon does
We rise, and shine, and fall
Over you that I rise, and shine, and crawl
Victims, aren’t we all?

What would there be
Beyond the eyes of Brandon Lee?
Could there be
A revenging angel left to bleed?

Wanted the truth, wanted the faith
More than anything else in this world
But we are doomed, body and soul marooned
I would never give in

Just like the moon does
We rise, and shine, and fall
Over you that I rise, and shine, and crawl
Victims, aren’t we all?

Just like the moon does
We rise, and shine, and fall
Over you that I rise, and shine, and crawl
Victims, aren’t we all?

Aren’t we all?
Aren’t we all?

Just like the moon does
We rise, and shine, and fall
Over you that I rise, and shine, and crawl
Victims, aren’t we all?

Just like the moon does
We rise, and shine, and fall
Over you that I rise, and shine, and crawl
Victims, aren’t we all?

Aren’t we all?
Aren’t we all?

Angel
