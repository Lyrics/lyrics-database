Would you give me the key to the empire of bliss?
Gimme substance to dismiss
Everybody’s searching for a difference
Everybody’s searching for the liveliness
Gimme just another reason to live

Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood
Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood

Would you give me redemption in your kiss?
Gimme something that I already miss
Everybody’s searching for difference
Everybody’s searching for providence
Gimme just another reason to live

Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood
Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood

Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood
Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood

Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood
Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood

Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood
Things you can resist, things you cannot
They’re just framed in blood

Things you can resist, things you cannot

Things you can resist, things you cannot
