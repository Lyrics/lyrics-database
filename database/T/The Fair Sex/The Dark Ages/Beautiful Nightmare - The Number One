Never-ending ranks of winners
Grinning with the smile obscene
Marching over broken sinners
The leader of the pack is me

Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare
Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare

Call me prophet of all losers
Call me breaking down of hope
The captain of all aimless cruisers
Call me bringer of the dope

Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare
Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare

Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare
Oh yeah
What a beautiful nightmare

Beautiful nightmare come true
Beautiful nightmare come true
Beautiful nightmare come true
Beautiful nightmare come true
