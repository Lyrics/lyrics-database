It’s a force: you’ll never like it
It’s a theme that no one knows
It’s a force; you’ll never break it
Heaven knows why it comes again

Intensify ...
Intensify ...

I smash my head against the wall
Dark moments, go go!
I got a pain, and no one knows
It’s so wicked in every way

Neuralgia, no chance to hide
The doctor says, “it never fades”
It is sleepless and weakness
I feel it now: it’s coming now again

...
Intensify ...

I smash my head against the wall
Dark moments, go go!
I got a pain, and no one knows
It’s so wicked in every way

Neuralgia, no chance to hide
The doctor says, “it never fades”
It is sleepless and weakness
I feel it now: it’s coming now again

...
...
Again

...

Got a pain, and no one knows
Got a pain, and no one knows
Again
Again

...

Got a pain, and no one knows
Got a pain, and no one knows
Again
Again

...
No escape, no ...
...
I feel it now: it’s coming now again

...
