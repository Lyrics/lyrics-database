Too dangerous to keep
Too feeble to let go
And you want to bite the hand
Should have stopped this long ago

Go now, you’ve been set free
Another month or so, you’ll be gorging on me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile

Had you coiled around my arm
How could you ever know?
How I loved your diamond eyes
But that was long ago

Go now, you’ve been set free
Another month or so, you’ll be poisoning me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile

And I should have believed Eve
She said we had to blow
She was the apple of my eye
It wasn’t long ago

Go now, you’ve been set free
Another month or so, you’ll be poisoning me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile

Go now, you’ve been set free
Another month or so, you’ll be poisoning me
With your lovely smile
I see you slither away with your skin and your tail
Your flickering tongue and your rattling scales
Like a real reptile
