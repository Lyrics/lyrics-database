Ebb and flow, the sea is cold but my blood comes to boil
I feel it filling up my lungs, the weight pulls me to soil
Current takes me, breath escapes me, inducing coma sleep
Close my eyes, I’m paralyzed, finally at peace

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown?

Lay there floating, body bloating, skin turnin’ to gray
I built my castle, the dirty rascal finally got his way
Waves roll in and clean my sins, now everything is clear
I’m havin’ fun under the sun, wishin’ you were here

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown?

A thousand leagues, I live and breathe along the ocean floor
Now submersed, I join the cursed to float here evermore

Another sunny day, I feel like getting in the water
Why did you have to let me go?
Such a perfect way to spend my time and swim out farther
Why did you have to let me drown?
Drown?
Drown?
Drown?
