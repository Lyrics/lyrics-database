The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn’t stay away
Don’t you know the bitch came back?

I like her so much better when she’s down on her knees
Cause when she’s in my face that’s when I’m starting to see
That all my friends will laugh at thinking that we’d be wrong
Well she’s so fuckin’ stupid that she’s singing along

The trouble with girls is they’re all the same
Forget the diamonds and pearls they just want a ring
Before you know it you’re like a dog on a leash
Well you can try and change the world but you won’t change me

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn’t stay away
Don’t you know the bitch came back?

There she goes again just always breaking my balls
No matter what I do somehow it’s always my fault
She says I must be cheating cause I turned off my phone
But that’s the only frickin’ way she’ll leave me alone

The trouble with girls is is never enough
They love to complain and they never shut up
They like to tell you the way it ought to be
Go on and tell the world but just don’t tell me

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn’t stay away
Don’t you know the bitch came back?

It ain’t a joke when I say I wanna throw you out
(I really mean it, I really mean it)
Well look who’s laughing now!

The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
The bitch came, the bitch came back
She just couldn’t stay away

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she won’t stay the f*ck away

The bitch came back the very next day
Oh, the bitch came back, I thought she was a goner
But, the bitch came back, she couldn’t stay away
Don’t you know the bitch came back
