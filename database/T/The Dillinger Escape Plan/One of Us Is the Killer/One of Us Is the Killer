She moves abstract just
Like a shadow dancing on the edge
Like a storm cloud passing overhead
Effortless and free

As the hours rush by
Through her, I can sense the end of time
There's no way this can forever shine
Make the sun not rise

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

She moves abstract just
Like a shadow dancing on the edge
Like a storm cloud passing overhead
Hypnotizing me

As the hours rush by
Through her, I can sense the end of time
Stretching to eternity divine
And the sun won't rise

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
And the killer won't survive
And the killer won't survive

Survive
Survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
But the killer won't survive

In the air we tried to be
But you shot your arrow through me
Now one of us must die
And the killer won't survive
And the killer won't survive
