So many feelings
Pent up in here
Left all alone, I’m with
The one I most fear

I’m sick and I’m tired
Of reasoning
Just want to break out
Shake off this skin

I (I)
Can’t
Escape myself

All my problems
Loom larger than life
I can’t swallow
Another slice

Seems like my shadow
Mocks every stride
Can I learn to live with
What’s trapped inside?

I (I)
Can’t
Escape myself

So many feelings
Pent up in here
Left all alone, I’m with
The one I most fear

I’m sick and I’m tired
Of reasoning
Just wanna break out
Shake off this skin

I (I)
Can’t
Escape myself

I (I)
Can’t
Escape myself

I (I)
I Can’t
Escape myself
