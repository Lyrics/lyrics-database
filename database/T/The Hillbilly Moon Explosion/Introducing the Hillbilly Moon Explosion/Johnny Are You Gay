Johnny, are you gay?
You’re so good-looking
But something’s in the way
When I look in your eyes

Oh, Johnny you mean so much to me
I’ve waited so long for you to set me free
So I ask myself each day
Johnny, are you gay?

You’ve got a real cool shirt, yeah
It’s tight black satin
Not like the other guys, no
They all wear plaid and corduroy

I really dig your style
Need you to be my boy
So I ask myself each day,
Johnny, are you gay?

Shopping malls and station wagons, ain’t a lot for a girl like me
My ma was a naggy parent, so Johnny, won’t you set me free?
And take a look into my eyes, there’s lots of love for you
And tell me now, is it wrong to want to get more from you?

Johnny, are you gay?
I didn’t see you at the ballgame
I heard you gone shopping
Just you and Jasper Morgan

All I want is to be close to you
C’mon, give it a try
I know you’ll like it too
And now I ask myself each day…

Shopping malls and station wagons, ain’t a lot for a girl like me
My ma was a naggy parent, so Johnny, won’t you set me free?
And take a look into my eyes, there’s lots of love for you
Tell me now, is it wrong to want to get more from you?

Johnny, are you gay?
I saw you dancin’ techno
The way you move to the beat
Just supernatural (woo!)

Johnny, you mean so much to me
I’ve waited so long for you to set me free
And so I ask myself each day,
Johnny, are you gay?
Johnny, are you gay?
Johnny, are you gay?
