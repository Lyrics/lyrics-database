Forget everything you've ever learned in school
I don’t need no lessons, I don’t want no rules
I’m gonna show you something you gotta understand
Well, I love you better than your other man can

I’ve been on the road, well I’ve been around
I ain’t not a child, I can really get down
When are you women gonna understand?
Well, I love you better than your other man can

I see the way you’re looking
And you know, it makes me sad
I can tell by the look in your eyes
You miss something you never had

Beautiful heartbreak ... tears
I don’t want you begging down on your knees
If you really wanna be my gal
Well, I love you better than your other man can

Don’t leave me hanging down on the ledge
I rather you go and push me over the edge
When will you women understand?
Well, I love you better than your other man can

Well, I love you better than your other man can

Yes I will
Yes I will

I’m gonna love you, love you, love you…
Gonna love you…
Yeah!
Ooh!
