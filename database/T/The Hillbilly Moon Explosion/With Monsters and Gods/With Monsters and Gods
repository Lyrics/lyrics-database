I want to be gentle snow
Falling on your soft white skin
I want to be a tender breeze
Drifting through you
Mild and sweet

So here I am
Thunder and storm
High on the ridge
With monsters and gods
So here I am
A ghost in your dream
While the moon rises
I’m your heroine

A tender breeze
Mild and sweet
I’m going away
Are you thinking of me?
I’ll be your feather stroking your neck
I’ll be your ghost in the fields of your sleep

So here I am
Thunder and storm
High on the ridge
With monsters and gods
So here I am
A ghost in your dream
While the moon rises
I’m your heroine

The thunder rolls
Through the dark of the night
I’m the ghost in your dream
Your heroine queen

So here I am
Thunder and storm
High on the ridge
With monsters and gods
So here I am
A ghost in your dream
While the moon rises
I’m your heroine
Your heroine queen
