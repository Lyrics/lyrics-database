Black snake crawling across my hand
Talking like a natural man
Telling me he got a plan
Trouble knocking on my door
It’s a black snake

Black ghost smiling from a painting on the wall
Black ghost is a shadow
Cast by the memory of it all
Trouble knocking on my door
It’s a black ghost

Black ghost quit your talking
In my dreams at night
Black ghost quit your walking
Through my room in the twilight

Crawling across my bedroom floor
Trouble knocking on my door
It’s a black snake

Black ghost quit your talking
In my dreams at night
Black ghost quit your walking
Through my room in the twilight
