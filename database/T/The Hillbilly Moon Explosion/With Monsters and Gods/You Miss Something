Well everybody’s grinning and greased and gassed
And you miss something baby you never had

If you want to get your teeth knocked out
If you want to blacken your eye
Go to Bug Hill on a Saturday night
And you’ll know the reason why

Because everybody’s grinning and greased and gassed
And you miss something baby you never had

Women on my doorstep, women on my phone
Knocking down my door saying, “please take me home”
Feels like a thrill when you pop that pill
And you’re rockin with Jeanie and rollin with Jill

Everybody’s grinning and greased and gassed
And you miss something baby you never had

We’ve got drinks on the table, vodka and gin
Some mean homegrown and some aspirin
We got vinyl on the stereo spinning rocksteady
Some punk rockabilly, so you better get ready

Everybody’s grinning and greased and gassed
And you miss something baby you never had

You got an itch, don’t know what it is
Come running to me saying, “scratch it please”

Everybody’s grinning and greased and gassed
And you miss something baby you never had
