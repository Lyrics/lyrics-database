I can’t sleep
I can’t eat
I feel a force knock me off of my feet
The light’s gone out and there’s nowhere to run
And I fall down-down into a deep depression

You sucked the life out of me
Cut the mains, drained the energy
Somebody’s gone and rammed a stake through my heart
A ghost from the past, a cry in the dark
The light’s gone out and there’s nowhere to run
And I fall down-down into a deep depression

Gonna take a drive to I don’t know where
Roll the windows down
Feel the cool night air
Make me feel alive, get into gear
I gotta run-run-run from this deep depression

Darkness closing in on me
Why can’t you set me free?
Drink-drink-drink, numb my mind
Happy pills for the daily grind
Well, the light’s gone out and there’s nowhere to run
And I fall down-down into a deep depression
