A toy sword in your hand
You’re king of all your lands
Your eyes are twinkling
So wild at heart

A bath towel
For your cape
Blue pants over your trousers
Don’t fly too far
Not too far away — I’ve got you, got you

A quick hug at the door
Running wild for your scores
There’s nothing you must fear
As long as I’m near

I can’t imagine a world
Without you
Without you

Forgotten homework on your chair
Strange traces in your lair
There’s something you might fear
You don’t know yet, my dear

I can’t imagine a world
I miss you
I miss you
I miss you

I can’t imagine a world
I miss you
I miss you
