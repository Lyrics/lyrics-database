Would you leave if I cry?
I am sorry I told you a lie
For if you ever leave me
I will feel left alone to die

Broken heart
Now you’ve gone and you’ve broken my heart
Broken my heart
In so many parts, oh my love

For you know that I care
And I need your loving so…
For you know that I love you
And never let you go

Broken heart
Now I’m gone and you’ve broken my heart
Broken my heart
In so many parts, oh my love

Broken heart
Now I’m gone and I’ve broken your heart
Broken my heart
In so many parts, oh my love, oh my love
