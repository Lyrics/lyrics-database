If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do

If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Well, you got your reasons
And you got your lies
And you got your manipulations
To cut me down to size

Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't (XXX?)

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do

If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Seems the road less traveled
Shows happiness unravel
And you got to take a little dirt
To keep what you love

That's what you gotta do

Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't

You're stretching out your arms to something that's just not there

Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do

If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me

Sayin' you love but you don't
You give your love but you won't

You won't

Sayin' you love where you stand
Give your heart when you can

If you could only see the way she loves me
Then maybe you would understand
Why I feel this way about our love
And what I must do

If you could only see how blue her eyes can be when she says
When she says she loves me
