Oh, it's opening time
Down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation
And get out for a bit

Because I feel it all fading
And paling
And I'm begging to drag you down with me
To kick the last nail in

Yeah I like you in that
Like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth
Then I cannot be responsible for

Quite what goes in
Or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair
Just pull on your pout

And let's move to the beat
Like we know that that it's over
If you slip going under
Slip over my shoulder

So just pull on your face
Just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time
Down on Fascination Street

So pull on your hair
Pull on your pout
Cut the conversation
Just open your mouth

Pull on your face
Pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time
Down on Fascination Street

Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
On Fascination Street
