So the fire is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of thoughts
And I've run right out of words

As I used them up
I used them up

Yeah the fire is almost cold
And there's nothing left to burn
I've run right out of feeling
And I've run right out of world

And everything I promised
And everything I tried
Yeah everything I ever did
I used to feed the fire

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire

But the fire is almost out
Is almost out
And there's nothing left to burn
No there's nothing left to burn

Not even this

And the fire is almost dead
And there's nothing left to burn
I've finished everything
Yeah

And all the things I promised
And all the things I tried
Yeah all the things I ever dreamed
I used to feed the fire

I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire
I used to feed the fire

But the fire is almost out

Half my life I've been here
Half my life in flames
Using all I ever had
To keep the fire ablaze

To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze
To keep the fire ablaze

But there's nothing left to burn
No there's nothing left to burn

And the fire is almost out
The fire is almost out
Yeah the fire is almost out

Almost out, almost out
Almost out, almost out

And there's nothing left to burn
