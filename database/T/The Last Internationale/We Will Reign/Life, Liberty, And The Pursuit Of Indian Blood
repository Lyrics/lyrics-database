Follow me love
Into tomorrow
We’ll leave behind
Our chains and sorrow
We won’t walk
With Pizarro
Follow the man with the
Flaming arrow

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!

Come on love
I know you want to
Reclaim the street with the
Berlin statue
We’ll burn the streets
Regrow the forest
We’ll rob the richest
Give to the poorest

Come on love
Come on love

I don’t need it
I don’t want it
Build another

I don’t love it
I won’t feed it
Find another

When the sun sets down
When the sun sets down
Gunpowder will wash the streets
With Indian blood
And the seeds of revolution
Will grow tight around
Our children’s necks
Like nooses
That are used to keep
The slaves in check
In chains
And decades later
We still can’t figure out why
It remains the same

(Blood)

Wake up love!
I want some action
Unlock the children
They’ll make it happen
But if comfort
Is your coffin
Then pull the lever
And choose your killer

I don’t need it
I don’t want it
Build another

I don’t need it
I won’t feed it
Find another

I don’t love it
I won’t feed it
Build another

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!
Blood!

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!

Blood!
Blood!
Blood!
