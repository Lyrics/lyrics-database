We won’t wait for fallen angels
We don’t need no miracles
We seize on every moment
Come on baby, ride this movement

Do you think they really love you
As they kill and rise above you
We know they don’t really love us
They can never really love

The more I love
The more I feel like making revolution
The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

We’re not revolutionaries
Sittin’ ’round and talkin’ theories
We speak in a different fashion
Our language is direct action

For every one or two to stop us
We multiply three or four
No one or army can stop us
Cut ’em down on the killin’ floor

The more I love
The more I feel like making revolution
The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

Do you think they really love you
As they kill and rise above you
Do you think they really love us
As they kill and rise above us
We know they don’t really love us
We know they can’t really love us
We know they won’t really love us
They can never really love!

The more I love
The more I feel like making revolution
The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

The more I make revolution
The more I feel like making love

Hey hey, hoka he hey!
Hoka he hey
Hoka he hey
Hey hey
