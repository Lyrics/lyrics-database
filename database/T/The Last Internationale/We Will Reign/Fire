You gotta hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Oh believe it

Oh oh…
Oh oh…

Woke up feelin’ lonely
There’s always something to be missed
I don’t know if he regrets
Breaking me with a kiss

Devil comes knockin’
Don’t have the strength to resist
I wanna lay it all down
But a voice tells me this ain’t it

(She says you gotta)

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Oh believe it

Oh oh…
Oh oh…

Woke up feelin’ lonely
There’s always someone to be missed
I dont know if he remembers
Breaking me with a kiss

When the devil comes knockin’
I’ll have the strength to resist
I don’t care if he regrets it
I’ll make him pay for what he did

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Hold that fire
Before you lay that burden down
Carry it higher
Before you lay that burden down

Oh oh…
Oh oh…
Oh oh…
Oh oh…
