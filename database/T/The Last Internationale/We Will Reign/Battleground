All my life I’ve been fighting fear
Been dragged and buried in this world alone
The sounds of thunder I could always hear
Had me feeling so sick I called this hell my home

I left my love and everything behind
I know where I’m going
Won’t be turned around
Until it breaks I’m holding down the line
’Til we are free from the marching sound

I know what is true
I know what to do
and I’ll see it ’til it’s through

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
’Til the final round

I’m young and fearless
With a fist of stone
Learned to stand on my feet
But this is not my land
I’ve seen my reflection and I’m not alone
We’ll take it all instead of what we can

We know what is true
We know what to do
and we’ll defend it ’til it’s through

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
’Til the final round

Until we are free
We won’t be moved or be turned around
Until we are free
We’ll keep on rising to the marching sound
The marching sound!

Hold your battleground
Where the hammers sound
Hold your battleground
’Til the final round
