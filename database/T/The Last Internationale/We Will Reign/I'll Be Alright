Pick me up
When you’re coming down
Pull me in
No, put me out
I’ll be gone ’til
Your heart is lost for me

Woah… lost for me
Oh, you’ll be lost for me

Cuz when the light
That you’re holdin’
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it’s better
Not to see outside
So goodnight, my baby
I’m not your fight
Keep on…

I’ll be alright

Love me through
The harshest winter
Break my blues
With your warmest summer
Hold my hand
In the hardest rain
We will dance with our tongues
In the air
Spin until we land
anywhere
Then I’ll be gone ’til
your heart is lost for me

Woah… lost for me
Oh, you’ll be lost for me

Cuz when the light
That you’re holdin’
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it’s better
Not to see outside
So goodnight, my baby
I’m not your fight
Keep on…

I’ll be alright

When the light
That you’re holdin’
Shines no longer bright
Sometimes it’s better
Not to see outside
So goodnight, my baby
I’m not your fight
Keep on…

I’ll be alright

Oh, alright
I’ll be alright
Keep on, Keep on
I’ll be alright
