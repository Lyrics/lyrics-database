Every mornin’ head into the mines
Breathin’ in that devil’s dust
You put in all your time
Doing what you must
So the bills don’t fall behind

You didn’t need any help then
And you won’t be needin’ any now
You got a load on your back
A chain around your heart
And a pride that’s tearin’ us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

All the nights that I waited
For you to come home
And when you’d do we’d cuss and fuss
It ain’t that I don’t love you
It’s cuz it’s too much
And I couldn’t tell you enough

But we made it through
All these years
What doesn’t kill you
Only makes you stronger
And baby I know
Nothin’s really changed
Only now we’re a little older

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together

Every day you come home
A little more tired
I hear you coughin’
All through the night
Always another year
Until you retire
When the doctors say
You’re not alright

You didn’t need any help then
Surely you’ll be needin’ plenty now
You got a load on your back
Chain around your heart
And a pride that’s tearin’ us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt up
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together
