It's like a dream
From which I'm never waking
And it's like a scene
That has a different show

Inside of me
That never has an ending
Though inside you bleed
That cutting you for more

It's like a feel
That everything is falling
And it's like the night
Is swallowing the day

The clear blue sky
Resentments are awaking
And I feel the tears
Are washing me away

I feel so far away
I feel so far away
Far away, far away
Far away, far away

It's like a war
Where everyone has died
And it's like a flash
Of lightning in the night

It's like you're sinking
Deep into the bottom
Like inside to feel
Like giving up the fight

It's like the price
That's only just my design
To push you on
To make you believe

It's like a gun
To take you to the bottom
Make you realize that
There's nothing there to prove, yea

I feel so far away
I feel so far away
Far away, far away
Far away, far away

Far away, far away
Far away

Our love is lost
And
I'm still so far away
You see me far away

Something keeps me holding on
You see me far away
I'm dreaming far away
Until the dream is gone
