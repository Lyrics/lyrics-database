I hear voices inside my head,
They must be CIA.
Man, I really love my country,
The U.S. of fuckin’ A!

They’re whispering in my ear,
Telling me what to do:
Buy gasoline and rags,
And some lighter fluid too!

The CIA made me burn down a hospital,
I have no idea why!
Man, I hope it was full of terrorists,
Because every fucker in there died!

Kerosene is an accelerant,
I put some in the nursing wing.
Their fire suppression must’ve goddamn broke,
I mean, it didn’t do a fucking thing!

I will gladly serve my country proud,
I hope the voices are pleased with me.
The CIA gave me a brand new job,
And it’s another round of arsony!

The CIA made me burn down a hospital,
I still have no idea why!
I hope it was full of pedophiles,
Because every person in there died!

They say I’m a domestic terrorist,
Just ’cause six thousand people died.
Well, the CIA told me to do it, man,
Do you think that they would fucking lie?

The voices say that I need to do more,
They’re yelling at me through the walls!
How could I say no to the CIA?
They put tracking chips in my balls!

The CIA made me burn down a hospital,
I still got no idea why!
I hope it was full of globalists,
’Cause everyone in there died!

Hospital turned into a pile of ash,
Is there something wrong with me?
I think I leveled an entire fucking town,
Was this all a schizophrenic dream?

The CIA made me burn down a hospital,
I have no idea why!
Man, I hope it was full of terrorists,
Because every fucker in there died!
