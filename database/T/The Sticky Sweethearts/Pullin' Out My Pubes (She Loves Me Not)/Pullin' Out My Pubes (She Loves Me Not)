Sittin’ in my room
Cryin’ like a fuckin’ tool
I’ve tried everything
What else could I possibly do?

You got me pulling out my pubes
You got me pulling out my pubes
You got me pulling out my pubes
Tryin’ to get back to you!

Pullin’ and pullin’ ’em
And  fuckin’ plucking’
Don’t tell me that I’m pullin’ out
My pubes for fuckin’ nothing!

Like…

She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)

I’ve got my pubes in the palm of my hand
I threw them up into the breeze
And wherever they may land
Will lead me to my destiny

You got me pulling out my pubes
You got me pulling out my pubes
You got me pulling out my pubes
Tryin’ to get back to you!

Pullin’ and pullin’ ’em
And fuckin’ plucking’
Don’t tell me that I’m pullin’ out
My pubes for fuckin’ nothing!

I put my hands to my face
Cried so hard that I couldn’t breathe
Forgot my pubes were still in my hands
Inhaled them deep into my lungs
I started choking on my pubes
Right in front of you and your new dude
I puked them out all over your dress
…and the rest is history, I guess!

Pullin’ and pullin’ ’em
And fuckin’ plucking’
Don’t tell me that I’m pullin’ out
My pubes for fuckin’ nothing!

Like…

She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)

My pubes are in God’s hands! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
I threw them up into the breeze
And wherever they may land
She loves me! (She loves me not)
Will lead me to my destiny

She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me! (She loves me not)
She loves me…
