Aww!
Holy shit

I was driving to your house
After your mom and dad fell asleep
Next thing I know, I heard a bang!
You gotta keep that dog on a leash!

He didn’t get flat
He didn’t get wrecked
His body parts were blown apart
Yet somehow still intact

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new
With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

I started with the head
Glued it to the neck
Glued the legs
And the tail next

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

Your father came out, screamed in disbelief
He saw me glueing your dog in the middle of the street
I said, “I’m doing the best I can,
But there’s too much fur glued to my hands!”

Your father pulled me aside
With tears falling out of his eyes
He said that dog was his only friend
Got him through the worst of times

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new
With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

I started with the head
Glued it to the neck
Glued the legs
And the tail next

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

Woof-woof!
He said, “Is he alive?”
I said, “No way man, I was just making that noise”
Yeah, yeah, woof-woof!

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new
With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

I started with the head
Glued it to the neck
Glued the legs
And the tail next

With just a little glue
He’ll look good as new

Woof, woof, woof
Aww!

Oh shit…
