I glued my balls to my butthole again
Oh my God, what did I do?
I can’t take a dump ’cause now my balls
Are blockin’ up my butthole

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on glue
Good God, I pulled too hard
Now my scrotum’s stretched out like a fuckin’ yard

Oh God

I glued my balls to my butthole, baby
Oh my God, what did I do?
I can’t take a dump ’cause now my balls
Are blockin’ up my butthole

My lady doesn’t want a life
Of watchin’ her man use a butter knife
Face-down, ass-up, trying to saw off his sack
Oh baby, fuckin’ please just take me back

I glued my balls to my butthole, baby
Oh my God, what did I do?
I can’t take a dump ’cause now my balls
Are blockin’ up my butthole

Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, shame on glue
Good God, I pulled too hard
Now my scrotum’s stretched out like a fuckin’ yard

I glued my balls
It was inevitable, baby
This could have happened to anyone
Life is just fun like that

I glued my balls to my butthole, baby
Oh my God, what did I do?
I can’t take a dump ’cause now my balls
Are blockin’ up my butthole

Good God, I pulled too hard
Now my scrotum’s stretched out like a fuckin’ yard

Good God, I pulled too hard
Now my scrotum’s stretched out like a fuckin’ yard
