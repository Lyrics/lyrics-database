Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

In the dark bathed in Cathode ray blue
Miss Red Hook of 1922
Weeping silently for the pain of others

Every night a tearful rosary
A victim of the curse of empathy
Her reward for compassion is to suffer

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

My shortcomings, I know, caused her grief
Still she loves me, this I can’t believe!
Responding not with anger but a prayer

Heaven’s just Southwest of Cobble Hill
True, I am the son of an Angel
Maternally not one woman compares

Nettie (Nettie),
No need to cry (to cry)
Let me (let me)
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

(If you fall, I will catch you)
(When you’re lost, I’ll be there soon)
(Far away, but of course near)
(When you’re sad, I’m always here)

Thank you for saving me from myself
Your compassion became its own hell
Unequivocally beautiful inside and out
Without a doubt

Nettie,
No need to cry
Let me
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Nettie (Nettie),
No need to cry (to cry)
Let me (let me)
Wipe those tear drops from your eyes

Let me…
