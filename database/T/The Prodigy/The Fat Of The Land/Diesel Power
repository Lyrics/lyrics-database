Yo, I used to check out lyrics upon the format
Build with skill, with technique, computer A-DAT
My lyrical form
Is clouds on your brainstorm
I get hyped, think, thought flow
Acrobat
Sink the track
Pump the track
Dance missions
Clubs like spores react past those visions
And hurrying more
Reflects on the dancefloor
Blowing up
And having mad people showing up
Packing crowds
Jam-packed venues
Needles collapse
While atmospheres continues
Sprinkle that
Winnin’ like that
Movin’ like that
Hittin’ like that
The melody is phat
Yo, I’m on the energy source
The cosmic boss
With Prodigy
Kickin’ astrology
My intellects devour
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta…

Winston back rewind - diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantasically
It has to be
Automatically
Check it out
You better work it out
Change to another route
My techniques, strategies, abilities
I leave cords of mikes hanging like spring leaves
Do a track so fast, beyond from you and I
Lyrical tactics, vocal gymnastics
E’s and pepped up
You get swept up
Smacked up, backed up
Your crew’s all cracked up
Check it - slow pick
Choose quick
You can’t stick
My medical range is strange as angles
You get tangled
Twist inside affections
Channels repeat
Complete
Can’t compete
Check that our texture
Mind adventure
Exploit the point
Into tracks to devour
My intellects proceed
With diesel power

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta…

Back
Attack
The whack
Pack your fax to me
You don’t want none
High quality action be
Still standing, damaging your other manic
Quick reverse
Potent as the first verse
My amplifier
Blows on your worlds, higher
World’s sire
Cuts like a barbwire
Record - play
I pull up on you every day
Fast forward
I move and I swing toward
Exit - load
Put your brain in write mode
Selected mix
The man will perfect the fix
Heads lightly
Bite me
Copy Xerox
Cops’ handblocks
You can’t knock some out there
I’ve been lifting
Shifting
Persisting
Intelligent kingpin
Keeping astrology
As I roll with Prodigy

With diesel power
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fanta…

Model 706-8073421, robot sonic

Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
Blows your mind drastically, fantastically
