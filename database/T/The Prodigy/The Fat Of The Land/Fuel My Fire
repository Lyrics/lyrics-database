I’ve got word of thanks
Thanks that I’d like to say
For the rage that I feel
The rage that I feel today

Gotta stack, gotta stack
Stack of chips on my shoulder
In everything I do
’Cause I made, I made
I made the mistake of trusting you

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just burn

Yeah, my layers are thick
And I’ve got bad attitude
Yeah, that knife in my back
Has fingerprints that belong to you

Got a grudge, got a grudge
Got a grudge that I’m holding
For as long as I live
’Cause you lied, you lied
You lied to my face
And it’s something that I can’t forgive

People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just fuel my fire
People like you just burn!
