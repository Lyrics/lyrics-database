What are you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
What are you gonna do when the hounds are calling?

You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves while I hunt like a hound.
You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves, shout it out loud!

You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves while I hunt like a hound.
You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves, shout it out loud!

You run
You run with the wolves

You run with the wolves

You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves while I hunt like a hound.
You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves, shout it out loud!

You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves while I hunt like a hound.
You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves, shout it out loud!

What are you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
What are you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
What are you gonna do when the hounds are calling?
What are you gonna do?

You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves while I hunt like a hound.
You’re a mug, that’s why I had to quiet you down,
You run with the wolves, shout it out loud!

You run
You run with the wolves

You run
You run with the wolves

You run with the wolves

You run with the wolves

You run with the wolves

You run
