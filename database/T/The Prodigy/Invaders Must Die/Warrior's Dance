Come with me to the dance floor
You and me, ’cause that’s what it’s for
Show me now what is it
We got to be doing
And the music in the house
And the music in the house
And the music in the house is so…

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!

Come with me to the dance floor
You and me, ’cause that’s what it’s for
Show me now what is it
We got to be doing
And the music in the house is so

Come with me to the dance floor
You and me, ’cause that’s what it’s for
Show me now what is it
We got to be doing
And the music in the house
And the music in the house
And the music in the house…

Do it!
Do it!
Do it!
Do it!

Come with me to the dance floor
You and me, ’cause that’s what it’s for
Show me now what is it
We got to be doing
And the music in the house
Is so…

Come with me to the dance floor
You and me, ’cause that’s what it’s for
Show me now what is it
We got to be doing
We got to be doing
And the music in the house

Do it!

Music, music, music, music

"There’s no siren, man"
"Ay?"
"There’s no wooo"
