Take me to the
Take me to the
Take me to the
Take me to the hospital

Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital

Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
I wanna give it to my London posse
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
I wanna give it to my London posse

Along came a spider
He was creepy like Dracula
He spoke like he was a friend
So I came with adrenaline

Hold it!

Welcome to the scene of the crash
Welcome to the scene of the crash

Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the

Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
I wanna give it to my London posse
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
Push up your hand if you’re lovin’ my style
I wanna give it to my London posse

Welcome to the scene of the crash
Welcome to the scene of the crash

Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the hospital
Take me to the
