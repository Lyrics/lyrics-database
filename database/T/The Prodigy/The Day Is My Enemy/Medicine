A spoonful of sugar just to sweeten the taste
Just to keep you in your place
A spoonful of sugar just to sweeten the taste
Just to keep you in your place
Just to keep you in your place
Just to keep you in your place

Never surrender, in sickness
Never surrender, in sickness
Never surrender, in sickness
