I need the rhythm to put me in the mood
I need a rhyme to make my body move
I need the rhythm to put me in the mood
I need a rhyme to make my body move

I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I need the rhythm to make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I need the rhythm to make my body move

To make my body, make, make, make my body
To make my body, make, make, make my body move

Rhythm bomb
Rhythm bomb
Make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm to make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm to make my body move

Rhythm
Bomb

I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I need the rhythm to make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I need the rhythm to make my body

I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I need the rhythm to make my body move

To make my body, make, make, make my body
To make my body, make, make, make my body move

Rhythm bomb

I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm to make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm to make my body move

Rhythm bomb

I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm to make my body move
I need the rhythm, I need the rhythm
I, I, I need the rhythm
