Take it back
Take it back
Bring it back, take it, take it back
Bring it back, take it, take it back
Take it back
Take it, take it back

Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot

We take the silence
Noise-making tyrants
Hijack the pirates
Bring it back, take it, take it back
Take it back

Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot

We take the silence
Noise-making tyrants
Hijack the pirates
Bring it back, take it, take it back
Take it back
We take the silence
Noise-making tyrants
Hijack the pirates
Bring it back, take it, take it back
Take it back

Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see what you’ve got
Drive on straight through the roadblox
Let me see, let me see your tyres hot

Take it back
Take it back
Back
Take it back
Back
Take it back
Back
Take it back
