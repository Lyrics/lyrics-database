In the wild frontier, off the beaten track
In the wild frontier, better watch your back
Where your dreams get real or your blood gets spilled
Gotta face your fears in the wild frontier

In the wild frontier, off the beaten track
In the wild frontier, better watch your back
Where your dreams get real or your blood gets spilled
Gotta face your fears in the wild frontier

In the wild frontier, in the wild
Danger!
In the wild, In the wild
Danger!
In the wild frontier, in the wild
Danger!
In the wild, In the wild
Danger!
In the wild frontier, in the wild
Danger!

In the wild frontier, off the beaten track
In the wild frontier, better watch your back
Where your dreams get real or your blood gets spilled
Gotta face your fears in the wild frontier

In the wild frontier, in the wild

In the wild frontier, off the beaten track
In the wild frontier, better watch your back
Where your dreams get real or your blood gets spilled
Gotta face your fears in the wild frontier

Danger!
In the wild, In the wild
Danger!
In the wild frontier, in the wild

In the wild frontier, in the wild
In the wild frontier, off the beaten track
In the wild frontier, better watch your back
Where your dreams get real or your blood gets spilled
Gotta face your fears in the wild frontier
