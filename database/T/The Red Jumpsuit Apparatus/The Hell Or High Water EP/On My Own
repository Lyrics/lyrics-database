Take a breath
Look around
You can see how it’s all coming down
Close your eyes
Just give in
Divided we fall but together we win

I don’t know if I can make it on my own
I need you ’cause you have always helped me through

It is time
Cross the line
I want only to help free your mind
Send your doubts
I’m with the wind
Divided we fall but together we win

I don’t know if I can make it on my own
I need you ’cause you have always helped me through
Hopefully this is only just a dream
’Cause I can’t live without the only one who makes me feel
Anything

At all (oh)
Anything
At all (oh)

I don’t know if I can make it on my own
I need you ’cause you have always helped me through
Hopefully this is only just a dream
’Cause I can’t live without the only one who makes me feel
Anything
