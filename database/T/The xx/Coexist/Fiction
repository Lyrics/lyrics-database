Fiction
When we’re not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

I wake up alone
With only daylight between us
Last night the world was beneath us
Tonight comes too long

Were we torn apart
By the break of day
You’re more than I can believe
Would ever come my way

Fiction
When we’re not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

Come real life
Why do I refuse you?
Cause if my fear’s right
I risk to lose you

And if I just might
Wake up alone
Bring on the night

Fiction
When we’re not together
Mistaken for a vision
Something of my own creation

An uncertain haze
How am I to tell?
I know your face all too well
Still I wake up alone

Fiction
When we’re not together
