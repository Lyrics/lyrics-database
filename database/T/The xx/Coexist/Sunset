I saw you again
It felt like we had never met
It’s like the sunset in your eyes
And never wanted to rise

And what have you done
With the one I love
When I look into your eyes
I see no surprise

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

We make believe
I’ve never seen your face, you neither mine
Don’t catch my eye
Don’t register a smile

You were more than just a friend
Oh, but the feeling
It never came to an end
I can’t bear you seeing

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me

When I see you again
I’ll know not to expect
Stay one step away
We won’t have to wave

When I see you again
And I’m greeted as a friend
It is understood
When we did all we could

I always thought it was sad
The way we act like strangers
After all that we had
We act like we had never met

I always thought it was a shame
That we have to play these games
It felt like you really knew me
Now it feels like you see through me
