I watched you breathe in
And I wished you’d stop
Only for long enough
Long enough

It’s
Hard
To
Say

Separate or combine
I ask you one last time
Did I hold you too tight?
Did I not let enough light in?

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh

If a feeling appears
If your mind should sway
It’s not a secret you should keep
I won’t let you slip away

We used to be closer than this
We used to be closer than this
We used to get closer than this
Is it something you miss?

We used to be closer than this
We used to be closer than this
We used to get closer than this
Is it something you miss?

Winged or chained, I ask you
Would you have stayed?
Did I hold you too tight?
Did I not let enough light in?

Oooh, oooh, oooh, oooh
