You used to have all the answers
And you, you still have them too
And we, we live half in the daytime
And we, we live half at night

Watch things on VCRs
With me and talk about big love
I think we’re superstars
You say you think we are the best thing

But you
You just know
You just do

When I find myself by the sea
In another’s company by the sea
When I go out to the pier
Gonna dive and have no fear

Because you
You just know
You just do

Watch things on VCRs
With me and talk about big love
I think we’re superstars
You say you think we are the best thing

But you
You just know
You just do
