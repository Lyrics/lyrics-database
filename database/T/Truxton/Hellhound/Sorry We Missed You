I Took My Baby
On A Saturday Bang

Go!
Getcha freak on

Boy Is That Girl With You
Yes We're One And The Same

Go!
Getcha freak on

Now I Believe In Miracles
And A Miracle
Has Happened Tonight

Go!
Getcha freak on

Go!
Getcha freak on

Go!
Getcha getcha getcha getcha, getcha freak on!

But, If
You're Thinkin'
About My Baby
It Don't Matter If You're
Black Or White

Go!
Getcha freak on

Go!
Getcha freak on

Go
Getcha getcha getcha getcha, getcha freak on!

Is that yo chick?
People you know
Me and Timbaland been hot since 20 years ago
Now what the dealy yo
Now what the drilly yo

If you wanna battle me then (nigga)
Let me know
Holla! Gotta feel me son
Let me throw you some
People here I come
Now sweat me when I'm done
We got the radio shook like we got a gun

Sometimes I feel
Like I don't have a partner
Sometimes I feel
Like my only friend
Is the city I live in
The city of Angels
Lonely as I am
Together we cry

I drive on her streets
'Cause she's my companion
I walk through her hills
'Cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and
She kisses me windy and
I never worry
Now that is a lie
