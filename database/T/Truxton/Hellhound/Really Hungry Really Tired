Dark in the city night is a wire
Steam in the subway earth is afire
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
Woman you want me give me a sign
and catch my breathing even closer behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret)

I'll keep you my dirty little secret
(Dirty little secret)
Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret
(Don't tell anyone or you'll be just another regret)

Dirty little secret
Who has to know?
(Dirty little secret)

All our times have come
Dirty little secret
La, la la, la la
Dirty little secret

All our times have come
Dirty little secret
La, la la, la la
Dirty little secret

Here, but now there, gone
Dirty little secret
La, la la, la la
Dirty little secret

Stalked in the forest too close to hide
I'll be upon you by the moonlight side
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo

High blood drumming on your skin it's so tightv
You feel my heat I'm just a moment behind
do do do do do do do dodo dododo dodo
La, la la, la la
