Once upon a time, a long-long time ago
Way back in the mountains, where the wind is blowin’ cold
Lived a man in solitude, I can’t recall his name
All night long I hear him singing in my dream

Oh, sweet Devil Moon

Picking up the pieces of a long-forgotten dream
Old Blue Moon shines on every piece, it seems
Eagles drop their crosses on a chain of lead and steel
Riding to my heart by silver moonlight, so it feels

Oh, sweet Devil Moon

Where you headin’, baby?
Where you headin’, baby?
Are you headin’ for that moon?
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no

Now, where he eases your mind
And you’re gonna feel his breeze real soon
Now, when the Devil’s in your head
Gonna dance to the Devil Moon

Your soul is slowly burnin’
And your heart turned into stone
The mountain man will whisper
To that sweet old Devil Moon

Where has my baby gone?
Will I see her soon?
Will you take her from me
In a shining devil glow?

Oh, sweet Devil Moon

Picking up the pieces of a long-forgotten dream
Old Blue Moon shines on every piece, it seems
Eagles drop their crosses on a chain of lead and steel
Riding to my heart by silver moonlight, so it feels

Oh, sweet Devil Moon

Where you headin’, baby?
Where you headin’, baby?
Are you headin’ for that moon?
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no-no, no

Now, where he eases your mind
And you’re gonna feel his breeze real soon
Now, when the Devil’s in your head
Gonna dance to the Devil Moon
