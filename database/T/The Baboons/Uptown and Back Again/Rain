All the time, far as high
Going down, bad luck buying
Miles and miles, ride around
Rain

Down and down
Flying high, falling down like rain
Love contained and love unchained
Flying high, falling down like rain

All my trouble down the drain
Sky is crying
My heart is served
On a silver plate

When you’re down to earth
They fly high, falling down like rain
Love contained and love unchained
Flying high, falling down like rain

Rain…
Rain…
