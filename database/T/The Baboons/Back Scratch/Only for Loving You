I got a cockroach in my pocket
A fishbone in my shoe
Won’t take a trip this evening
Only for loving you

I bet mighty river won’t hold me
A thunder won’t hold me, too
I might even swim the ocean, darlin’
Only for loving you

Only for loving
Only for the things that your mama won’t do

I know you’re well and able
... until there’s too/two
If you give me your candy, I’ll take it
I’d be pleased if you let me to

I don’t wanna be your number two
I’ll be there right on time
I’ll be good at loving if you let me to
Will be there lemon than lime

Only for you sweet girls
I’m getting ordered for less
Only for the way you walk
And the sweet little words that your pretty mouth talk

The temperature is rising
My mind is failing me
There’s only one road I travel
And by your side is where I wanna be

No, I don’t wanna be your number two
I’ll be there right on time
I’ll be good at loving, if you let me to
Will be there lemon than lime

Only for loving you
Only for the things that your mama won’t do

Got a cockroach in my pocket
A fishbone in my shoe
Twenty four miles of walking
I’m gonna get back to you

Only for loving you
Only for the things you do
Only for the way you walk
And the sweet little words that your pretty mouth talk

And the sweet little words that your pretty mouth talk
