Going down, going down the dark track
I’m going down, there ain’t no turning back
It’s getting dark, big dogs are barking
Wolves howl, shadows are talking

Broken glass, rear-bladed dagger
Black shades, he looks like the devil

It’s dark, my hands all sweeting
Cold sweat, branches are cracking
Soft sheet of darkness covers me
A dark night, this is where I wanna be

Broken glass, rear-blades dagger
Black shades, he looks like the devil

Dark night, rain is pouring
High tide, rivers overflowing

Going down, going down the dark track
I’m going down, there ain’t no turning back

Broken glass, rear-bladed dagger
Black shades, he looks like the devil

Black shades, he looks like the devil!
