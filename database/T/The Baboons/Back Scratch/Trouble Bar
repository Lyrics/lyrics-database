Well, let’s drop by at the Trouble Bar
Just for pool to play
Let’s go down to the Lizard Lounge
Treat us as lost and stray

Oh, please
Tie me down
Hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Well, I took a shot of bourbon
Went to the whiskey lounge
... band began to play
Lost my cool ... snare
Treated as lost and stray

Oh, please
Tie me down
Hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more around

Men going missing in that troubled bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in that troubled bar
Makings of part of my own

They got a neon sign spelling "Trouble Bar"
They have a waitress wrapped in lace
They got everything, and a whole lot more
It’s a crazy, fucked-up place

Oh, please
Tie me down
Hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more around

... trouble in the Trouble Bar
And the cops are on their way
A whole lotta happened at that troubled bar
Blood all over my face

Oh, please
Tie me down
Hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Men going missing in that troubled bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in that troubled bar
Makings of part of my own

Well, there’s a whole lotta trouble at the Trouble Bar
And the cops are on their way
A whole lotta happened at that troubled bar
Blood all over my face

Oh, please
Tie me down
Hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Men going missing in that troubled bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in that troubled bar
Makings of part of my own

Yeah, makings of part of my own

Yeah, makings of part of my own!
