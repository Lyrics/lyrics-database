Well, let’s drop by at the Trouble Bar
Just for pool to play
Let’s go down to the Lizard Lounge
Treat us as lost and stray

Oh please, tie me down, hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Well, I took a shot of bourbon
Went to the whiskey lounge
And then the band began to play
Lost my cool by the twig of a snare
Treated as lost and stray

Oh please, tie me down, hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Men going missing in the Trouble Bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in that troubled bar
Makings of part of my own

They got a neon sign spelling “Trouble Bar”
They have a waitress wrapped in lace
They got everything, and a whole lot more
It’s a crazy, fucked-up place

Oh please, tie me down, hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Treat us as trouble in the Trouble Bar
And the cops are on their way
A whole lotta happened in that troubled bar
Blood all over my face

Oh please, tie me down, hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Men going missing in that troubled bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in the Trouble Bar
Makings of part of my own

Well, there’s a whole lotta trouble at the Trouble Bar
And the cops are on their way
A whole lotta happened in that troubled bar
Blood all over my face

Oh please, tie me down, hangin’ around
Bartender, please one more round

Men going missing in that troubled bar
Treated as lost and alone
Men going missing in that troubled bar
Makings of part of my own

Yeah, makings of part of my own
Yeah, makings of part of my own!
