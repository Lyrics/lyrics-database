Please, please don’t leave
I need your lovin’ so bad
You said you got the kind of lovin’
That I ain’t never had

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

All the lovin’ you need
I got it right at my heart
I say I’m hoping and I’m praying
That we don’t never part

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

Now if you thinkin’ about leaving
You can do it some other time
’Cause if you leave me, pretty baby
Don’t you know, you’re gonna mess up my mind?

Oh, don’t you leave me
I need you lovin’ so bad
I said you got the kind of lovin’
That I ain’t never had

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

If you think about leaving
You can do it some other time
’Cause if you leave me, pretty baby
Don’t you know, you’re gonna mess up my mind?

Oh, don’t be leaving me
I need your lovin’ so bad
I said you got the kind of lovin’
That I ain’t never had

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go

You thrill my soul, baby
Can’t let you go
