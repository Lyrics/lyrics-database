When dices roll
And thunder’s tracking
Where have you been?
My sweet delight
Every night
Oh, the calls are fading
Where have you been?
Bright morning light

Night time falls
And owls awaken
You can have
Them call your name
You can hear a sound
Oh it’s God-forsaken
I’m telling you
This ain’t no game

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Love’s like quicksand
Swallowing you
Every move
Might be your last
Going down slow
You better pray now
To your god
And do it fast

Dawn is a-breaking
Mosquito’s tears
This dirty sand
Is coming to your knees
Vultures circling
An eagle’s crying
Vultures circling
Oh mama, please!

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Quicksand rising
Wind blows mean
Things aren’t always
What they seem
When dices roll
And thunder’s tracking
Strange things happen
In your dreams

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Drowning in quicksand
Drowning in quicksand
