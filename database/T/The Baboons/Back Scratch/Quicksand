When dices roll and thunder’s tracking
Where have you been, my sweet delight?
Every night, oh them calls are fading
Where have you been, bright morning light?

Night time falls and owls awaken
You can hear them call your name
You can hear a sound, oh it’s God-forsaken
I’m telling you, this ain’t no game

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Love’s like quicksand swallowing you
Every move might be your last
Going down slow, you better pray now
To your god, and do it fast

Dawn is a-breaking, mosquito’s tears
This dirty sand is coming to your knees
Vultures circling, an eagle’s crying
Vultures circling, oh mama, please

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Quicksand rising, the wind blows mean
Things aren’t always what they seem
When dices roll and thunder’s tracking
Strange things happen in your dreams

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Stepping in quicksand
Sinking down deep
Oh, drowning
In quicksand

Drowning in quicksand
Drowning in quicksand
