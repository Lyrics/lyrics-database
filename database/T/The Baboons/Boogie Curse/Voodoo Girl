I don't remember how I got you this low
... ... ... burn out soon
Well, there's a girl on the floor turning slowly around
The beating of my heart is the only sound
Yes, she's a… voodoo girl

Bloodshot eyes in my direction
She confused me, I could not pay attention
She spoke thirty words, and I got scared
She said, “I know who you are and you better beware”
Yes, she's a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl

Well, she got on the floor
She reached me her hand
Confused once more, then she started to dance
Feeling kinda funny, something happened to me
I realized that I would never be free
Yes, she's a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl

Eating, spleeing, or walking the street
... ... let me be
When I'm not ... home ... hair
... she got me under her spell
Yes, she's a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl

Voodoo girl
Voodoo girl
Girl, girl
Voodoo girl
