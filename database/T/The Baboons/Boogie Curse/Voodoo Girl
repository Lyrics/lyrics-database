I don’t remember how I got you this low
It’s dark, just one candle, it's gonna burn out soon
Well, there’s a girl on the floor turning slowly around
The beating of my heart is the only sound

Yes, she’s a… voodoo girl

Bloodshot eyes in my direction
She confused me, I could not pay attention
She spoke thirty words, and I got scared
She said, “I know who you are and you better beware”

Yes, she’s a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl

Well, she got on the floor, she reached me her hand
Confused once more, then she started to dance
Feeling kinda funny, something happened to me
I realized that I would never be free

Yes, she’s a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl

Eating, sleeping, or walking the street
This haunted feeling just won’t let me be
When I’m not near her home ... hair
It’s getting me now, she got me under her spell

Yes, she’s a… voodoo girl
Voodoo girl
Voodoo girl
Voodoo girl, girl, girl, girl, voodoo girl
