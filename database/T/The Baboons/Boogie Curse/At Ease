You know baby, I love you so
You know baby, that I just can’t go

My mind is weary, blood pressure running low
You say you’ll change, but then you don’t
My toes are feeling the silence before the storm
I can feel the chemistry in your bones

Why don’t you baby, why don’t you
Put your mind at ease?

Well, my tears are filling oceans in the night
Let me tell you one thing that ain’t right
Caught by the Devil in his flight
Smashed me to the rocks with all his might

Well, I’ve tried to love you, in seven million ways
Wish I can love you till the end of my days

Why don’t you baby, why don’t you
Put your mind at ease?

My tears are filling oceans in the night
Let me tell you one thing that ain’t right
Bad luck and trouble, pain and misery
Seem to come my way occasionally

Well, I try to avoid you, ignore you when I can
You’ve got my heart in a frying pan

Why don’t you baby, why don’t you
Put your mind at ease?

Yeah, why don’t you baby, why don’t you
Put your mind at ease?

Why don’t you, why don’t you
Put your mind at ease?
