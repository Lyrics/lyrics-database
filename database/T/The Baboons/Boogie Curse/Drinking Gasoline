Well, I’m driving down the road in my Cadillac
Traffic lies nearby, all road turning black
Drinking gasoline is a whole lotta do
Drinking gasoline to get over you

We were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell

Well, I met you in the desert at Sabriskey Point
Out of gasoline, we ran out of oil
Really filled my tank, you’re quite Tomar
Drinking gasoline out of your silver cup

We were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell

Well, I drove ten thousand miles away from home
See no traffic jam, but in a desert storm
Drinking silver cup is a whole lotta do
Drinking silver cup baby, me and you

We were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell

Engine started smoking, wings on fire
Big wheels started shaking, and I lost a tyre
My baby, she exploded drinking gasoline
That doggone, that doggone, that mean machine

We were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell

Well, I’m driving down the road in my Cadillac
Traffic lies nearby, all road turning black
Drinking gasoline is a whole lotta do
Drinking gasoline to get over you

We were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell

Oh yea, we were doing swell
With a short way from half onto hell
