Deeper down

It’s everywhere I look from Las Vegas to right here
Under your dresser right by your ear
It’s creeping in sweetly, it’s definitely here
There’s nothing more deadly than slow growing fear

Life was full and fruitful and you could take a real bite
The juice pouring well over your skin's delight
But the shadow it grows and takes the depth away
Leaving broken down pieces to this priceless ballet

The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into the fade out line
The shallower it grows the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into deeper down

Did we build all those bridges to watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won’t be a party with weathering frocks

The shallower it grows the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into the fade out line
The shallower it grows the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into the fade out line

Heading deeper down
We’re sliding without noticing our own decline
Heading deeper down
We’re hanging onto sweet nothings left behind

Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Deeper down
Down, deeper down, yeah

Did we build all those bridges to watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won’t be a party with weathering frocks

Did we build all those bridges to watch them thin down to dust?
Or blow them voluntarily out of constant trust?
The clock is ticking its last couple of tocks
And there won’t be a party with weathering frocks

The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into the fade out line
The shallower it grows, the shallower it grows
The fainter we go into the fade out line

We are all plunging straight towards our own decline
Without noticing we slide down, deeper down
The shadow grows without ever slowing down
We are heading straight into the fade out line

Deeper down
