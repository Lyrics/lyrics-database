When we were young our future was so bright (whoa, oh!)
The old neighborhood was so alive (whoa, oh!)
And every kid on the whole damn street (whoa, oh!)
Was gonna make it big and not be beat

Now the neighborhood’s cracked and torn (whoa, oh!)
The kids are grown up but their lives are worn (whoa, oh!)
How can one little street
Swallow so many lives?

Chances thrown, nothing’s free
Longing for used to be
Still it’s hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
(Whoa!)

Jamie had a chance, well she really did (whoa, oh!)
Instead she dropped out and had a couple of kids (whoa, oh!)
Mark still lives at home ’cause he’s got no job (whoa, oh!)
He just plays guitar and smokes a lot of pot

Jay committed suicide (whoa, oh!)
Brandon OD’d and died (whoa, oh!)
What the hell is going on?
The cruelest dream, reality

Chances thrown, nothing’s free
Longing for used to be
Still it’s hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams

Chances thrown, nothing’s free
Longing for used to be
Still it’s hard, hard to see
Fragile lives, shattered dreams
