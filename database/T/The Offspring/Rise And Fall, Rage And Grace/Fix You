She wakes up
Rage and grace
Pulling me closer, pushing away at me
The sharpest thorn on your vine
Twistin’ and turnin’, we’re all intertwined

Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know, we’d all like to rearrange"

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

A beaming sunrise buries the night
The setting sun destroys the light
And she says, "Baby, I’ve gotta get going"
Cutting each other without even knowing

She sees a million stars like holes in the sky
All god’s tears for her, they cry
And I am in her reign

I wish I could fix you
And make you how I want you
I wish I could fix you
And I wish you could fix me
I wish I could heal you
And mend where you are broken
I wish I could heal you
And I wish you could heal me

Broken wing
Empty glass
Words that scream and bounce right back
She says, "You know, we’d all like to rearrange"
