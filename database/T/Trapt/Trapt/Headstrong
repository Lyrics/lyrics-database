Circling, you’re circling, you’re circling your head
Contemplating everything you ever said
Now I see the truth, I got a doubt
A different motive in your eyes and now I’m out
See you later

I see your fantasy
You wanna make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that’s over

I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide

Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we’re headstrong
Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong

I can’t give everything away
I won’t give everything away

Conclusions manifest
Your first impression's got to be your very best
I see you’re full of shit, and that’s alright
That’s how you play, I guess you get through every night
Well, now that’s over

I see your fantasy
You wanna make it a reality paved in gold
See inside, inside of our heads, yeah
Well, now that’s over

I see your motives inside
Decisions to hide

Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we’re headstrong
Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong

I can’t give everything away
This is not where you belong
I won’t give everything away

I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
I know, I know all about
Your motives inside
And your decision to hide

Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
Headstrong, we’re headstrong
Back off, I’ll take you on
Headstrong to take on anyone
I know that you are wrong
And this is not where you belong
Where you belong

This is not where you belong
I can’t give everything away
This is not where you belong
I won’t give everything away
This is not where you belong
This is not where you belong
