Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee Wee reads the evening news
A pre-owned song or a second-hand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose

Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hezbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming an AOR

Meanwhile…

I like Cal and his dog Napalm
I like Ike and his itty-bitty A-bomb
Everybody got one, I want mine
You can order it up on Channel Nine

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

There was a time but it’s long gone
Janie got a crush on the Viet Cong
Burning through downtown Saigon
But me, I’m sold - down the Mekong

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

Guns, and cars, and accidents
The threatened witness my defence
You can sell one another for fifteen cents
Well bye-bye mother, it’s common sense

Meanwhile, in the Sheraton
Doctor Jeep plays on, and on, and on

Everybody shouts on I Love Lucy
Pee Wee reads the evening news
A pre-owned song or a second-hand Uzi
Everybody got a job to lose

Here come the golden oldies
Here come the Hezbollah
Businessmen from South Miami
Humming an AOR

Meanwhile (meanwhile)
Doctor Jeep plays on (plays on, and on, and on)

Meanwhile…
