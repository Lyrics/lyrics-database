A chasm grows
In the cavity of serpentine teeth
Hunger pangs strike
For the sweet feast of innocent blood
Of innocent bloodshed
Now here we go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I’ve opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it’s worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They’ll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

The gaping wounds
Hemorrhaging the blood from which they feast
Eat us alive
Consume to feed a hunger with no
A hunger with no end
Let’s fucking go

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I’ve opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it’s worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They’ll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

This battle’s not the same which they have led us to believe
A synthesis of propaganda, terror and deceit
We are the cattle; they the slaughter; our meat: gasoline

They pump us through the machine’s valves to cleanse the world’s "disease"
We are the ammunition that will cause all life to cease

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They’ll rain their holocaust down from the sky

The vampires feed off the wars of mankind
The vampires feed off the wars of mankind

Growing fat on the throne of an empire
Tyrant rules with the threat of a great fire

I’ve opened up my eyes
Seen the world for what it’s worth
Tears rain down from the sky
They’ll blow it all to bits
To prove whose god wields all the power
Blood rains down from the sky

Annihilate
All those who stand in their way
Obliterate
They’ll rain their holocaust down from the sky
