Wherever did you find this place?
I’ve traveled now for days and days
It’s very cold and uninviting
Feels that I’m not wanted here

You say your world was torn apart
By the one who won your heart
But I will never let you down
I’m waiting on the edge of town

On the edge of town
On the edge of town
Mmm-hmm

You say you’re marked upon your face
Fighting with the small town ace
How many times I have to say?
These people, they don’t like to change

You’ve been a friend to start no other
Respected you just like a brother
For I will never let you down
I’m waiting on the edge of town

On the edge of town
On the edge of town
Hm, yea-yea

I’ll be here, yeah!
(Don’t you know?)
(Living in this small town)
(You wanna come on home)

You found it hard to make ends meet
Oh, I’ll help you get back on your feet
For I will never let you down
I’m waiting on the edge of town

On the edge of town
On the edge of town
Hmm-mm, yea-yea-yea

I’ll be here, yeah!
(Don’t you know?)
(You gotta come on home)
(Long way from home)
