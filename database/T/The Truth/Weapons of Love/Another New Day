I was down and alone
I had no way of knowing
’Til your love came along
I was lost in my ruin

But now I wake and I rise up
And I face
(Another new day)
Feeling like I’m born again
(Another new day)
Calls on me, calls on me, yeah
(Another new day)
Feeling like I′m born again
(Another new day)
Won’t slip away

No way

I had no sunshine
There was only rain
I had rocks in my bed, yea
And pillows of pain

But now I wake and I rise up
And I face
(Another new day)
Oh, feeling like I’m born again
(Another new day)
It calls on me, calls on me, yeah
(Another new day)
Feeling like I’m born again
(Another new day)
Won′t slip away

I can fall in your eyes
As I wake and I rise up
And I face
(Another new day)
Oh, feeling like I′m born again
(Another new day)
Calls on me, calls on me
(Another new day)
Feeling like I’m born again
(Another new day)
Won′t slip away

Another new day
Another new day
