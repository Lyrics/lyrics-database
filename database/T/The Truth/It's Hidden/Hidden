Long road I have travelled,
For every time.
Through the darkness I will run,
With nowhere to hide.
Oh, it’s a funny thing,
You can’t change what the future brings.

It’s hidden (hidden),
Hidden in your eyes.
It’s hidden (hidden),
Underneath your smile.

Cold rain hits like thunder, deep within.
I fear that burns to my soul, to rise again.
It’s a funny thing, a part of you lives inside of me.

It’s hidden (hidden),
Hidden in your eyes.
It’s hidden (hidden),
Underneath your smile.

Run through the fire, turn down the walls.
Break out of the door, inside can hear your heartbeat call.
No easy answers left in this world,
Facing the madness if the life could, too, be learned.
Oh, too be learned…

I’ve been waiting here for you,
I’ve been watching your every move.
I give you my life or let it shine,
The secret is between us 'til the end of time.

It’s hidden (hidden),
Hidden in your eyes.
Oh, it’s hidden (hidden),
Underneath your smile.

Oh, it’s hidden (hidden),
Running through the night.
It’s hidden (hidden),
Hidden for the night.

It’s hidden (hidden),
Hidden in your eyes.
It’s hidden (hidden),
They believed your smile.

Oh, it’s hidden (hidden),
Running through the night, yeah.
It’s hidden (hidden),
Oh, hidden for the night, yeah.
