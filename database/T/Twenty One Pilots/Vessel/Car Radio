I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it’s dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
’Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

Sometimes quiet is violent
I find it hard to hide it
My pride is no longer inside

It’s on my sleeve
My skin will scream
Reminding me
Of who I killed
Inside my dream
I hate this car
That I’m driving
There’s no hiding for me

I’m forced to deal with what I feel
There is no distraction to mask what is real
I could pull the steering wheel

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
’Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

I ponder of something terrifying
’Cause this time there’s no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence
One thing consists of consistence
And it’s that we’re all battling fear
Oh dear, I don’t know if we know why we’re here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking
I liked it better when my car had sound

There are things we can do
But from the things that work, there are only two
And from the two that we choose to do
Peace we’ll win, and fear we’ll lose

And there’s faith and there’s sleep
We need to pick one please because
Faith is to be awake
And to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive
And I will try with every rhyme
To come across like I am dying
To let you know you need to try to think

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
’Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…;

And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit in silence
And now I just sit…;

I ponder of something great
My lungs will fill and then deflate
They fill with fire
Exhale desire
I know it’s dire
My time today

I have these thoughts
So often I ought
To replace that slot
With what I once bought
’Cause somebody stole
My car radio
And now I just sit in silence
