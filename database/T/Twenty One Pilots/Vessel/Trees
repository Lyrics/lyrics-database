I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that’s where I am
Silent in the trees
Why won’t you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello, hello, hello, hello

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And that’s where I am
Silent in the trees
Why won’t you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly

I can feel your breath
I can feel my death
I want to know you
I want to see
I want to say

Hello
Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello, yeah

Hello, hello, hello, hello
