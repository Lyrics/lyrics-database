Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone, lone, lone

I-I-I-I’ve got a migraine
And my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it’s Friday ’cause Fridays will always
Be better than Sundays ’cause Sundays are my suicide days

I don’t know why they always seem so dismal
Thunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it’s the weather or the letters by my bed
Sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Let it be said what the headache represents
It’s me defending in suspense, it’s me suspended in a defenseless test
Being tested by a ruthless examinant
That’s represented best by my depress…;

…;ing thoughts
I do not have writer’s block, my writer just hates the clock
It will not let me sleep, I guess I’ll sleep when I’m dead
And sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid

I am not as fine as I seem, pardon
Me for yelling, I’m telling you green, gardens
Are not what’s growing in my psyche, it’s a different me
A difficult beast feasting on burnt down trees

Freeze frame please, let me paint a mental picture portrait
Something you won’t forget, it’s all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents
That make Pandora’s Box’s contents look nonviolent

Behind my eyelids are islands of violence
My mind’s shipwrecked, this is the only land my mind could
Find, I did not know it was such a violent island
Full of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions

They’re trying to eat me, blood running down their chin
And I know that I can fight or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find
’Cause sometimes to stay alive you got to kill your mind

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

And I will say that we should take a day to break away
From all the pain our brain has made
The game is not played alone

And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it
And keep it frozen and know that
Life has a hopeful undertone

Am I the only one I know
Waging my wars behind my face and above my throat?
Shadows will scream that I’m alone
But I know we’ve made it this far, kid

Made it this far
Made it this
