Now, the night
Is coming to an end

The sun will rise
And we will try again

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die

I will fear
The night again

I hope I’m not
My only friend

Stay alive
Stay alive for me
You will die
But now your life is free
Take pride in what is sure
To die
