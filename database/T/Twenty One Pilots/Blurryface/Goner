I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I want to be known by you
I want to be known by you

I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I want to be known by you
I want to be known by you

Though I’m weak and beaten down
I’ll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I’m inside-out, you’re underneath

I’ve got two faces, blurry’s the one I’m not
I’ve got two faces, blurry’s the one I’m not
I need your help to take him out
I need your help to take him out

Though I’m weak and beaten down
I’ll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I’m inside-out, you’re underneath

Though I’m weak and beaten down
I’ll slip away into this sound
The ghost of you is close to me
I’m inside-out, you’re underneath

Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone
Don’t let me be gone

Don’t let me be
Don’t let me be
Ah, yeah

I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I’m a goner, somebody catch my breath
I want to be known by you
I want to be known by you
