Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh

When the leader of the bad guys sang,
Something soft and soaked in pain,
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway,
He must’ve forgot to close his door,
As he cranked out those dismal chords,
And his four walls declared him insane.

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You’re the judge, oh no, set me free,
You’re the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul’s freezing,
Hell’s hot for good reason, so please, take me.

Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh

Three lights are lit but the fourth one’s out,
I can tell ’cause it’s a bit darker than the last night’s bout,
I forgot about the drought of lightbulbs in this house,
So I head out, down a route I think is heading south,

But I’m not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth,
I’m a pro at imperfections and I’m best friends with my doubt,
And now that my mind’s out, and now I hear it clear and loud,
I’m thinking, "wow, I probably shoulda stayed inside my house."

I found my way,
Right time, wrong place,
As I pled my case.

You’re the judge, oh no, set me free,
You’re the judge, oh no, set me free,
I know my soul’s freezing,
Hell’s hot for good reason, so please,

I don’t know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don’t know if this one is about me or the devil.

I don’t know if this song is a surrender or a revel,
I don’t know if this one is about me or the devil.

You’re the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
You’re the judge, oh no, set me free, oh no
I know my soul’s freezing,
Hell’s hot for good reason, so please,

Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
Na na na na, oh oh
