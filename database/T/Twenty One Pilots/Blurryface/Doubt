Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity,
Scared of my own ceiling, scared I’ll die of uncertainty,
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety,
Don’t know what’s inside of me.

Don’t forget about me,
Don’t forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I’m no good without you.

Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping,
I’m not sure if I can see this ever stopping,
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, no,
You are all that I’ve got, no.

Don’t forget about me,
Don’t forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I’m no good without you.

Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system,
Repeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted,
I want the markings made on my skin,
To mean something to me again,
I hope you haven’t left without me, please.

Don’t forget about me,
Don’t forget about me,
Even when I doubt you,
I’m no good without you, no no no no

Hey! Hey!
Don’t forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don’t forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don’t forget about me, no
Hey! Hey!
Don’t forget about me, no
