Sometimes you gotta bleed to know
That you’re alive and have a soul
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

The songs on the radio are okay
But my taste in music is your face
And it takes a song to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

You fell asleep in my car I drove the whole time
But that’s okay I’ll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I’m driving here I sit
Cursing my government
For not using my taxes to fill holes with more cement

Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, oh, oh
That you’re alive and have a soul, oh, oh
But it takes someone to come around
To show you how

She’s the tear in my heart
I’m alive
She’s the tear in my heart
I’m on fire
She’s the tear in my heart
Take me higher
Than I’ve ever been

My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I’ve ever been

Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been
Than I’ve ever been

My heart is my armor
She’s the tear in my heart
She’s a carver
She’s a butcher with a smile
Cut me farther
Than I’ve ever been
