Gimme something skin
Something like a flower
Gimme something warm
Sometihng like a river
Gimme something hot
Something ready to start
Gimme something strong
And I’ll sing this song

Gimme something skin
Something like a shelter
Gimme something deep
Something you don’t wanna keep
Gimme something love
Something without a glove
Gimme something wrong
And I’ll sing this song

One foot of skinflowers
Skinflowers

Gimme, gimme, gimme

What is burning inside?
We wanted some outside
What is burning inside?
We wanted some outside!

One foot of skinflowers

Skinflowers

I said, skinflowers

Flowers
