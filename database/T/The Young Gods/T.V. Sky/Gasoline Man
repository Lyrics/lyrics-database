I’m a gasoline man
I dunno where I go
I’m gonna drive and drive
I wanna get there on time

Yea, I’m a gasoline man
And I know how to ride
I’m gonna drive and drive
Find out where you hide

I’m a gasoline man
I dunno where I go
I’m gonna drive and drive
I wanna get there on time

I’m a gasoline man
That’s the way I feel
I wanna take my hand
And put it on the wheel

Say a little prayer for the mother
Gasoline, baby
Say a little prayer for the mother
Let’s go for a ride!

I’m a gasoline man
Gonna set your road on fire
And don’t try to put it out
The flames will just go higher

Got some gas for you
And got some gas for me
But tonight I know
I’ll have enough for two

Say a little prayer for the mother
Gasoline, baby
Say a little prayer for the mother
Let’s go for a ride

Thank you light
You taught me how to bend
Thank you wolf
You taught me how to bite

I’m a gasoline man
Dunno where I go
Yea, I’m a gasoline man
Gonna get there on time
I’m a gasoline man
Gonna find out where you hide
’Cuz I’m a gasoline man
Gonna set the world on fire

Say a little prayer for the mother
Say a little prayer for the mother, baby
Say a little prayer for the mother
Say a little prayer for the mother

Let’s go!
’Cuz I’m a gasoline man
Yea, I’m a gasoline man
’Cuz I’m a gasoline m-man
