I believe in eye-deceivin’
Bob’n’weavin’, I can breathe in
Make a wish in flower fish
Moving vibration, mild relation
I’m jamaican on your radio station
Got a curse in, could be worse in
You first in a hearse in
Good as dead as, nothing left in
Nothing left in, some might heading
I need a head rest in, feed from a warm breast

A man making hits with my child-bearing hips
Underground like, who’s it sound like
You all sound the same but you don’t know my name

I believe in people lying
I believe in people dying
I believe in people trying
I believe in people crying

I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

We all sound the same, you don’t know my name
Rearrange, and things don’t change
Things remain, feel the strain
Stress, catch my breath

Get some rest (XXX there’ll be a new tale of)
From the mess (He and I)
Couldn’t care less (In fact any time, every day)
Sugar cane (Write fictional stories)
Is like smack to my vein
Shook flame (If you want to)
But I don’t complain (On the street, in your home)

I believe in different reasons
I believe in breakthrough seasons
I believe when snow flakes fall
I believe in buildings tall

I believe in people bombing
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that’s why I’m running

Keep living
Keep living

You’ve gotta ask (There’ll be a new tale)
Before he attacks (Of he and I)
You’ve got the flats (In fact any time)
Dub my sacks (Every day)
You’ve got the city (Writing fictional stories)
Move out of the country
I’m scrunching (If you want to)
Friends that are punchy (On the street, in your home)

I believe in people falling
I believe in people warring
I believe diseases coming
I believe that’s why I’m running

I believe in people balking
I believe in people talking
I believe in people breathing
I believe in people being

Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
Keep living
