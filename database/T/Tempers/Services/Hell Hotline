He watched his future turn to powder
As he looked out over the water
Put out his cigarette, gave fate a chance
Took her out to a seaside dance

He was born to die in a seaside casino
Pretty lights, pretty lights
You see some beautiful things
Get lost

He was born to die in a seaside casino
Pretty lights, pretty lights
You see some beautiful things
Get lost

How hope is like a golden devil
He wore his best black tie
Tied himself up best he could
In a house of flashing tricks, flashing tricks

He was born to die in a seaside casino
Pretty lights, pretty lights
You see some beautiful things
Get lost

He was born to die in a seaside casino
Pretty lights, pretty lights
You see some beautiful things
Get lost
