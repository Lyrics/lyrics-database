Just say the word and I’ll be on my way
Regardless of the time, it’s just how I was made

To explain, I’m here for a reason so make use of me
I’m hungry and I’m thirsty and I hope you’ll be joining
My father is a helper, but my father made mistakes
I see myself in him as I’m a product of his ways
Or maybe I just like the attention

You can stay here tonight, I won’t ask any questions
Don’t call it polite, it’s just a suggestion

Please stay here tonight
Please stay here tonight

I’d be a liar if I said I felt ready for this
I have a past and a poison, that I can admit
But this is what I need to bury the years of debris
To break the circle of the cycles and stop living vicariously
And start living for me
