If you’re looking for a place
To hang your head in shame
The light is always on
So come on in
My eyes are too big for my stomach
It can’t process all that I do
A rich diet of endless endeavors
At the expense of me and you
There’s a thousand reasons why I can’t open up
Every combination is one turn off
There’s no rest for the weak
I need a week’s rest desperately
