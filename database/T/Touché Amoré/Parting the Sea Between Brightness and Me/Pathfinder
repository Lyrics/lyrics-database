I feel what’s best for everyone is to forget about me when I’m gone
Because it hurts to be missed and no one is deserving this
With my back to a hardwood floor
I understand that I’m not a provider but a center divider
I got lanes to explain the different ways I behave
A life thats a detour to where I am not sure
But if the sun is in my eyes I think I’m doing the right thing
I rely on exit signs, and destination times
And this drive that knows me better than I think I know myself
With that being said I won’t play pretend
That I’m not growing up, that I’m not giving in
Late nights and all night drives are the reason why I’m alive
And I’m not going anywhere
