the voices carry still
across these dull great plains
growing louder everyday
sinking back to habits dying hard
your arms are so familiar
these wounds that time won’t heal
fester with hate so pick the scab
and turn the page
until the lion lears to write,
the hunter will be glorified
flip the switch
and here I sit on the outside
eight dollar haircut (fuck you)
these words are my leash
that I cannot untie
dragging meinto this night
cover my ears, but still you call my name
I will follow you (deeper into this night)
dim the lights and tighten this noose
I’ve lost myself in you
I won’t settle for anything less
not one if us immune
