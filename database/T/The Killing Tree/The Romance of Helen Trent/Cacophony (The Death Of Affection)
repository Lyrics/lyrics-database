Lie with those sweet words that fall from your lips
Stare so cold and calculating worth the risk
Escape from this life of expectations to finally die free

The virus grows inside my head here
It makes me speak in screams and whispers
No need to apologize
I see deceit behind your eyes

There is nothing left for us here

Start a war
A war for two
A final suicide
I can share with you

The death of affection
Under your discretion
Breathe life to the lifeless
Breathe life
