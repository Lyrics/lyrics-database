I hold you and I am fearless
I touch you and I’m not afraid
I see you and I’m overcome
With feeling I cant explain

Come say that to my face
And I’ll rip out your fucking tongue
I reckon you you don’t know my name
Take it for granted while the blind
still dream in colors they’ve not yet seen

You are a deadline I can’t make
Better late then never I always say
The last of the romantic
Take this for granted while the blind
Still dream in colors they’ve not yet seen
And scrawl their thoughts
On pens that ran out of ink

no one to blame but myself

I see your face in the sky
Someday I’ll put this behind
I’m getting on with my life

I tried to tell you everything
But my voice is too loud
I tried to hold you close to me
But my claws are too sharp

I’ve seen that dead look before
Too paralyzed to move
Don’t try to hold me back
’Cuz you’re so afraid to lose

The same thing that keeps me alive
is the same one I’ll gladly bite
(tell me) That your sorry
(tell me) That you love me
(tell me) That you’ll be here now
While I go blind
Still dream in colors they’ve not yet seen
And scrawl their thoughts
on pens that ran out of ink

I see your face in the sky
Someday I’ll put this behind
I’m getting on with my life

I tried to tell you everything
But my voice is too loud
I tried to hold you close to me
But my claws are too sharp
But I tried

I see your face in the sky
Someday I’ll put this behind
(I tried to tell you everything but my voice is too loud)
I’m getting on with my life
And they tell me to look alive
