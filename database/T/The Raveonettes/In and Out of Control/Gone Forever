Baby, baby, I won’t forget you
In the night when I drink my head off
Memories of you and I
Help me, help me please

In the summer when we stood out
Stood out in a boring crowd
And the radio blasted out
Ramones and Rockaway Beach

And when you said everything’s a mess
I know you meant you and me, meant you and me
That’s when I knew, baby, this is the end
Oh baby, this is the end, this is the end

Baby, baby, when I told you
I wanna be just like you
You laughed ’cause you always wanted
To be somebody else

Now I tremble in New York City
The times we had were the best, yeah baby
Those times when we had each other
Are gone now, gone now forever

And when you said everything’s a mess
I know you meant you and me, meant you and me
That’s when I knew, baby, this is the end
Oh baby, this is the end, this is the end

And when you said everything’s a mess
I know you meant you and me, meant you and me
That’s when I knew, baby, this is the end
Oh baby, this is the end, this is the end
