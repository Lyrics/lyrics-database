Dream, little girl
On lonely street
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again

Your boyfriend’s mean
And your mom’s a bitch
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again

Run, run, run away
You’re gonna get your fun in this trashy world
Empty-hearted boys by your side
Lick your lips, and fuck suicide

Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight
Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight

You’re ripe for love
New York’s the shit
Little runaway girl
Do it again
Do it again

On the Brooklyn Bridge
You fix your stare
The East River sleeps
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again
Do it again

Run, run, run away
You’re gonna get your fun in this trashy world
Empty-hearted boys by your side
Lick your lips, and fuck suicide

Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight
Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight

Run, run, run away
You’re gonna get your fun in this trashy world
Empty-hearted boys by your side
Lick your lips, and fuck suicide

Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight (oh-oh-oh)
Suicide (oh-oh-oh)
Not tonight
