Can I beat ’em now?
Can I get your love?
Can I beat ’em now?
Can I get your love?

Don’t you realize
I long for your lips?
Don’t you realize
I long for your lips?

Let me out of here
Let me out of here

You drive me round and round, you drive me round and round
Until I crash into the stars
You take me for a spin, you take me for a spin
Until I crash into the stars

I’m breaking into cars
I’m breaking into cars

Can I beat ’em now?
Can I get your love?
Can I beat ’em now?
Can I get your love?

You keep ignoring me
And the teardrops fall
You keep ignoring me
And the teardrops fall

Let me out of here
Let me out of here

You drive me round and round, you drive me round and round
Until I crash into the stars
You take me for a spin, you take me for a spin
Until I crash into the stars

I’m breaking into cars
I’m breaking into cars

You drive me round and round, you drive me round and round
Until I crash into the stars
You take me for a spin, you take me for a spin
Until I crash into the stars

I’m breaking into cars
I’m breaking into cars
