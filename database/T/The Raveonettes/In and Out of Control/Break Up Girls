Bunny girls slapped around
You like boys to control you
Hit me, please, strike again
Sadistic girls, I don’t get you

Summer girls mad for love
Unleash hell on yourself
Knife the heart, bruised and used
Violent boys, I don’t get you

Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Please, please, please, please, please

Bunny girls hot for love
Your fur is bloody and torn
Hateful boys, alcohol
Your bunny’s down and she’s out

Come on, girls, take a stand
No one hurts you like you do
Pathetic boys, fuck you, yeah
Off to eternal damnation

Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Please, please, please, please, please

Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Break up girls, you might like it
Please, please, please, please, please
