I get away just for a while
I get to pine, I get to cry
Being without you
You think my world is tumbling down

You know the reason I can’t hurt
I got a heart of stone

I went away to meet my love
I saw things that I can’t have
It makes me mad
To think of you with someone else

You know the reason I can’t hurt
I got a heart of stone

I get away just for a while
I get to pine, I get to cry
Being without you
You think my world is tumbling down

You know the reason I can’t hurt
I got a heart of stone

You know the reason I can’t hurt
I got a heart of stone
