I never saw my dad on a midnight wave
Ripping in the darkness wild
I never saw my dad on a girlless beach
I never ever thought I would
I never ever thought I would

I never met my dad in a loving dream
Smiling in the moonless night
One time I saw my dad fuck a redhead whore
I never ever thought I would
I never ever thought I would

Are you gonna leave me
Are you now?
Do you feel that it’s ok
To leave a boy to drown
In this violent swell?
Never gonna see you again
Never gonna see you again
Never gonna see you again
