I fell out of heaven
To be with you in hell
My sin’s not quite seven
Nothing much to tell

Lust I haven’t craved
A saintly boy I’m not
I’ll take it to my grave
Beside it cursed I’ll rot

I ride these roads alone
Beneath the sulfur sky
Everywhere I roam
Life’s one big lie

When the fireball goes down
Out by alleyways
I come into town
But only for a day

Starving on my knees
I pray for you to understand
A man sure is weak
But lust holds my hand

I struggled and I cried
I pounced with no avail
At least I never lied
Or did the truth derail
