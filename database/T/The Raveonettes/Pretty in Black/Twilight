Honey, don’t kill that last cigarette
I got a long, long ways to go
I’ve been a-drinking and a-thinking all night long
Still got so much more to show
To you, yeah

And when that hand comes searching between your thighs
You better play along to the tune
You got nothing to prove, you’re a bad little girl
And you know your life is in ruins
So come on, yeah

So come on, yeah

And when the sun retreats and you got the chills
And your feet are aching to go
You better call on me ’cause I’m dog-gone horny
I’m not your friend but your foe
I’ve got so much time to please myself, I don’t count you in at all

All right, yeah

My heart is like a filling station
And it jumped with joy when you pulled in
And you later got caught for speedin’
And this drug-cop says you need him

But ain’t no walls in the jailhouse safe enough
To hold you down tonight
I’ll be right out here on the other side
Waiting for you by the red twilight

So when Friday comes and you got the chills
And your feet are aching to go
Don’t have to call on me ’cause I’m already there
Come on little girl, let’s go

Come on little girl, let’s go
Come on little girl, let’s go
Come on little girl, let’s go
Come on little girl, let’s go
