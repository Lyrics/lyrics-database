Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas I lost my man
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand

Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand
Somewhere in Texas I lost my man
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand

How many times do I have to lose you?
How many times do I have to lose you?
Do I have to lose you
Before I realize it’s too late?

A tornado is truly coming my way
A tornado is truly coming my way
It’ll sweep the land, I think I’ll stay
It’ll sweep the land, I think I’ll stay

Somewhere I lost my man
Somewhere in Texas by the yellow sand

How many times do I have to lose you?
How many times do I have to lose you?
Do I have to lose you
Before I realize it’s too late?
