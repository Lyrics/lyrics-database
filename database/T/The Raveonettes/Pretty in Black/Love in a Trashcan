If you touch that girl you know it’s okay
People say she’s a whore anyway
I think she looks like a nice vamp
Looking for love in a trashcan

If you kiss that girl you won’t be caught dead
She’s the coolest girl you think you ever met
I think she fits right into my life
On the road till the end of time

On the road till the end of time

Now the time is right and you feel the need
To go down low and receive a treat
The jukebox churns out songs about sex
Come on baby, you’re my best fix

Come on baby, you’re my best fix

Love, love in a trashcan
Love, love in a trashcan
