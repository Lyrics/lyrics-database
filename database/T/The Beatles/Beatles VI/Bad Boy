A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won’t do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don’t want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house, and plays the rock and roll music all night

Well, he put some tacks on teacher’s chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl’s hair
Now, junior, behave yourself

Buys every rock ’n’ roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets, (oh), is off to the jukebox, man
Well, he worries his teacher ’til at night she’s ready to poop
From rocking and rolling, spinning in a hula-hoop

Well his rock and roll has gotta stop
Junior’s head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Aw!

Aw!

Aw!

Gonna tell your mama, you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
You shoot the canary, and you fed it to the neighbor’s cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother’s laundromat

Well, in mama’s head it’s gotta stop
Junior’s head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself

Whoo!
