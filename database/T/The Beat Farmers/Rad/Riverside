When you moved up to Riverside
You thought the answer was hidden there
But it just turned out to be a place to hide
Baby, that town treated you so unfair

So meet me on out in the orange grove, baby
We’ll never back down at the broad wet storm
If the grove gets wet, it’ll freeze tonight
But I got something that’ll keep us warm

The moon-cat might be walkin’ tonight
The fog’s rollin’ in, no time to spare
We got the message of love to carry the light
If your daddy gets mad, baby, I don’t care

So meet me on out in the orange grove, baby
We’ll never back down at the broad wet storm
If the grove gets wet, it’ll freeze tonight
But I got something that’ll keep us warm

And if I look at you with a wicked smile
It’s ’cause a gypsy saw your face in my eyes
And if you give me an inch, I’m gonna take a mile
I’ve been waiting for you to see through my disguise

So meet me on out in the orange grove, baby
We’ll never back down at the broad wet storm
If the grove gets wet, it’ll freeze tonight
But I got something that’ll keep us warm
