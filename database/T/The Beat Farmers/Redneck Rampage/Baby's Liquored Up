My baby’s liquored up and she’s talkin’ to my friends
About this and that and t’other then she starts it all again
Head like a powder keg with hair that’s on fire
She’s lookin’ for a sucker or she found another buyer

Satan breaths sudden death sittin’ on the bar
Grabbin’ every butt she sees no matter who you are
Yellin’ at the cops, now she’s goin’ too far
She just blew lunch in my new car

(She’s all liquored up)
My baby’s all liquored up
(She’s all iquored up)
Lord, how’d she get so liquored up?
(She’s all liquored up)

She smiles like a reptile and her lips are razor thin
Her legs are made of jello but her voice can rip your skin
To hide her potty mouth she puts her skirt above her head
The whole Seventh Fleet is checkin’ out her spread

Foul gas shot glass stuck to her snout
In everybody’s business don’t care what it’s about
Rum, gin, anything, now it’s Guinness stout
The whole club’s praying that she finally passes out

(She’s all liquored up)
My baby’s so liquored up
(She’s all liquored up)
She said she’d be the designated driver
(She’s all liquored up)

Look at her, look at her go

Foul gas shot glass stuck to her snout
In everybody’s business don’t care what it’s about
Rum, gin, anything, now it’s Guinness stout
The whole club’s praying that she finally passes out

(She’s all liquored up)
My baby’s all liquored up
(She’s all liquored up)
A normally very nice girl but
(She’s all liquored up)
How-how-how-how-how-how liquored up?
(She’s all liquored up)
What? Well I’m outta here
(She’s all liquored up)
