I don’t want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do

I’ve lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I’ll have reached the goal I’m dreaming of

Believe me
I don’t want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

I don’t want to set the world on fire, honey
I love it too much
I just want to start a great, big flame
Down in your heart

You see, way down inside of me
Darlin’ I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know nobody else ain’t gonna do

I’ve lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you feel the same
I’ll have reached the goal I’m dreaming of

Believe me
I don’t want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart!
