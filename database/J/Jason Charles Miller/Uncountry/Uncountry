I spent my summers growing up looking for bullets from the Civil War
Wasn’t much else to do in that old Virginia town
I bought me a Gibson, got the hell out of Clifton while the gettin’ was good
Started making my living with a band and a van, no one understood
No one understood

Fifteen years of laying my head on a different stranger’s floor
Everyday’s another stage as you struggle with the pain from the night before
Drive until dawn, no sleep, no time to have a life of my own
’Cause there’s bills to pay and the only way is to keep on movin’ on
Just keep on movin’ on

I sweat and bleed for every dollar that I earn
I always break my back, and I never break my word
If you take a good look, I bet you’d see
There ain’t nothing uncountry about me

To see me up here on this stage, you might not believe
That I cut my teeth on “Country Roads” and “The Fightin’ Side of Me”
Now I’m no stranger to the pain that a hard day’s work will bring you
And ask me where I got these scars, I’ll be more than glad to sing you
My song of sad regret

I sweat and bleed for every dollar that I earn
I always break my back, and I never break my word
If you take a good look, I bet you’d see
There ain’t nothing uncountry about me

Oh I’ll fight through anything that’s in my way
I’m always gonna be here, and I ain’t never gonna break
If you take a good look, I bet you’d see
There ain’t nothing uncountry about
Nothing uncountry about me
Nothing uncountry about me!

Ain’t nothing uncountry about me
