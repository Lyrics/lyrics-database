Call me
If you like to hear my voice inside your mind
Slowly
We’ll pretend that I am yours and you are mine

Just for a while, there is you and I
Make believe, pretend, straight until the end
It’s just a lie, a sweet deception of the mind

Like a fantasy
All the things we do when we’re alone, they will not know
It’s just a phonecall if you wonder

It’s hard to comprehend
Believe until the end
Reality reframes
A universe in flames

Call me
If you’d like to… haah-haah

It’s just a phonecall
It’s just a phonecall if you wonder
It’s just a phonecall, haah
It’s just a phonecall if you wonder

Just for a while, there is you and I
Make believe, pretend, straight until the end
It’s just a lie, a sweet deception of the mind

Like a fantasy
All the things we do when we’re alone, they will not know
It’s just a phonecall if you wonder

It’s hard to comprehend
Believe until the end
Reality reframes
A universe in flames

So go on and claim me
Come make me feel alive
Go on and make me high
Go on and save me now

Like a fantasy
All the things we do when we’re alone, they will not know
It’s just a phonecall if you wonder

It’s hard to comprehend
Believe until the end
Reality reframes
A universe in flames

It’s hard to comprehend
Believe until the end
Reality reframes
A universe in flames
