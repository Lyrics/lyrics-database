(Missing you, missing you, missing you, missing you)
(Missing you, missing you, missing you, missing you)

Every time I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I’m still standing here, and you’re miles away
And I’m wondering why you left

And there’s a storm that’s raging through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles, and it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it’s almost driving me wild

And there’s a heart that’s breaking down this long distance line tonight

I ain’t missing you at all
Since you’ve been gone away
I ain’t missing you
No matter what I might say

There’s a message in the wire, and I’m sending you this signal tonight
You don’t know how desperate I’ve become
And it looks like I’m losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning, though I’m trying hard to understand

And it’s my heart that’s breaking, down this long distance line tonight

I ain’t missing you at all
Since you’ve been gone away
I ain’t missing you
No matter what my friends say

And there’s a message that I’m sending out, like a telegraph to your soul

And if I can’t bridge this distance, stop this heartbreak overload

I ain’t missing you at all
Since you’ve been gone away
I ain’t missing you
No matter what my friends say

I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I keep lying to myself

And there’s a storm that’s raging through my frozen heart tonight

I ain’t missing you at all
Since you’ve been gone away
I ain’t missing you
No matter what my friends say

Ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I keep lying to myself

Ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
I ain’t missing you
Ain’t missing you
Oh, no

No matter what my friends might say
I ain’t missing you
