Hahaha, yeah, yeah, goddamn, goddamn
Do I let that nigga live?
(Woah)
That nigga died on them
Sure

Uh, these bullets coming at you
Take these bullets for me, that’s my grimy waifu (Hot)
They keep on dumping the tool
Take these bullets from me, that’s my, ooh (Woah, huh)
These bullets coming at you
Take these bullets for me, that’s my grimy waifu (Huh, hah)
They steady dumping the tool
Take these bullets for me, that’s my (Ooh, ooh, ooh, man, you know what I’m sayin’)

I ain’t got no Birk’ bags (Ugh)
Fuckin’ with me, you gon’ get the price or tap
Music biz don’t give no pat on the back, ugh
Stack it up, stack it up, stack it up (Ooh)
Pack it up, pack it up, woah, hold on, man
Grown, live at the Days Inn
My appetite made me nauseous (Huh)
They thinkin’ Tinder with the topic (Cautious, uh)
I take the wins out with the losses
You see me grippin’ with the gossip
Now I’m eating dinner with the bosses
I hit the vape because it’s needed (It’s over)
I fall asleep like Tempur-Pedic
Got a light, got a light, got a light, I’ll be there
They kill my niggas for no reason
I hear ’em

These bullets coming at you
Take these bullets for me, that’s my grimy waifu (Hot)
They keep on dumping the tool
Take these bullets for me, that’s my, no

Here we go
We gotta do what we gotta do
Clap, clap, clap, clap
