You heard what I said, little nigga, come on
Fuck, hmph
You know what it is, nigga
Fucked up, huh
Yeah, nigga
Woah, woah, woah-ho, hey
You think you know me

Since you be alone, catch this heat alone
Fuck your niggas, holmes, they gon’ be alone
P94 leave that nigga prone
(Motherfucker tired of hearing snitch)

Ha, huh, now you wanna start? (Wanna start?)
Big dog, hah, now you wanna bark? (Shit)
Get the thang, let it spark (Brrr, bark)
Peglord should’ve died in the aughts (Yeah)
I ain’t gotta talk (Gotta talk)
When I see him I’ma send him to the Lord (Right)
One click, we gon’ empty his cart
Plant feet, take charge (Fucker)
We can’t find you at your job, we gon’ be at home (Blat)
Heard ya nigga up and coming, we gon’ put him on
I ain’t even gon’ try to conceal the chrome, let’s get it on
Yeah, now get him gone (Get him gone)
Bullets through his neck and his backbone (Ugh)
Filters (Filters), no stock in (No stock in)
One shot turn Steve Bannon into Steve Hawking (Fuck ’em)

Since you be alone, catch this heat alone (Huh)
Fuck your niggas, holmes, they gon’ be alone
P94 leave that nigga prone
(Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, don’t get up)

It’s the— Oh
It’s the ocean (It’s the ocean)
And the trees (The trees)
And the birds (And the bir—)
And the bears, damn (The bears)
Oh my God (Oh my God)
And the — Ooh
Got somebody, she’s a beauty
A beauty, a beauty

Really and truly
And truly, yeah (Hey, nice)
(Oh, oh, that was the word!)
