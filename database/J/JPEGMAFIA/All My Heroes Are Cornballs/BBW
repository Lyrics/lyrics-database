You think you know me
Oh, it’s stupid, but I will persevere
Oh
Yes
Sad man, uh

Rap and prison (Uh)
I know these basement dwellers need a villain (Oh)
How you livin’?
It’s Young Peggy without no pot to piss in
Heart throb, we pack pistols, we make your heart stop
Grab chest, meet God (Hahaha, sucka)
Rather go out the martyr way (Okay, martyr way?)
Still can’t believe I’m gettin’ paid off this art today (Damn, Peggy)
I’m the medicine man (Yeah), keep a zip in my hand (Yeah)
I do work on the stage (Haha), I still feel like a fan
Uh, when I pass I hope everything I did matter to you, baby, if it didn’t
Fuck it, when my body frigid (Yeah), all this music gon’ keep Peggy livin’
It’s the young, black, Brian Wilson
Smile at these crackers who want me dead (Ack)
Fire helmets won’t protect your head (Brrt)
Don’t get sent to Jesus filled with lead, lil’ nigga

Uh, ’sup
Yeah
You know what I mean?
Sometimes you just gotta keep it simple like that, it’s just, it is what it is, you know?
Yeah, hahaha
That’s what— that’s what my dad tells me, no not at all
That’s what my dad tells me, too, if I had a dad
My dad, my dad doesn’t—
Ah, yeah
