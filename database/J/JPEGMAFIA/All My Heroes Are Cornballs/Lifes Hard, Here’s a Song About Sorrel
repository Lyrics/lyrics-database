Alright, hundred percent
Uh, ahem
Yeah

Switch the quarter to the XLR, yeah
I ain’t even got no time for it, baby
I want you all to myself, oh
Even if I gotta rhyme for it (Uh)
It’s not important to the world (It’s not, baby, it’s not)
Drink it when I want to (Drink it when I wa—)
Sip it when I want to, baby (Sip it, man)

Sorrel
I feel the heel
Huh
Man, drink up
