You think you know me
You think you fucking knew me
Mm, mm (Ahem)
Mm, mm, mm, mm
Don’t rely on the strength of my image, baby (Hey)
If it’s good, then it’s good
Break it down, this shit is outta my hands, hey
I feel it (I feel it)
I feel (I feel it, I feel it)

I feel annoyed (Feel annoyed)
I’m feelin’ strange, I feel the gains, I fill a void (Void)
I’m still a roach, I’m doin’ shows, I feel employed (Feel employed)
Even though I’m coy (Though I’m coy), and you know that, boy
C’mon, I still feel the same (Same)
I feel afraid, this Easy A, I’m feelin’ framed (Feelin’ framed)
I wear a mask, I see the Banes
I’m still ashamed (’Shamed)
Even though they aim, it’s crazy, man
Feel like I’m losin’ hope (Losin’ hope)
I’m on the web, I net the gross, I see the growth (See the growth)
I feel engaged, I’m in the game, don’t need a coach
But I really do (Really do), really don’t (Nigga)
Huh, I just been in my head (In my head)
I’m gettin’ fried, I’m on the side, I’m Kevin Fed (Kevin Fed)
I played with fire, I can’t retire, I need the bread, stat (Man)

Don’t rely on the strength of my image, hey
If it’s good, then it’s good
Break it down, the shit is outta my hands, whoa
Said, don’t rely on the strength of my image, hey
If it’s good, then it’s good
Break it down, the shit is outta my hands, yeah

Look, I used to walk around with guns on me (Stupid-ass nigga)
Huh, I used to spin that bass to Michael Prophet (Yeah)
I used to think you wasn’t poppin’ until you had a stalker
I’m not no alpha male, I’m Carly Rae, you Braden Walker (Damn)
Look, ninety-nine ain’t a stack, baby
Say it (Ha), two times, feel like Casanova (Huh)
Y’all be praying’ to Jehovah, I be prayin’ to Hova (Let’s go)
I never whipped or sold the yola, still sold out the Nova (Damn)

Two claps right here (And that’s real too)
Alright, let’s clap
Mm, mm, mm
Try to find mine
Mm, mm, mm
I don’t wanna die
I don’t wanna
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm

Don’t rely on the strength of my image, hey
If it’s good, then it’s good
Break it down, the shit is outta my hands, no (Such a cool chord change)
Said, don’t rely on the strength of mine, mine
If it’s good, then it’s good
Break it down, the shit is outta my hands, no, huh (Baby)

Oh, you think I’m lying?
Fuck outta here, dawg
Sayin’, huh
Quicksand’s (Alright, man, yeah)
Too thick to stand (Go on, then)
Figure out now what it is that you need
I’ll step out for a minute to breathe
One set of footsteps in the sand, but I’m not being carried
If it gets out of hand, you can go on without me
