Britney, I can feel your sadness
The world is filled with madness
And everybody takes it out on you
And there’s nothing you can do
But girl, I want you to know
That I’m not one of those

Because I don’t care what they all say
I’d still have sex with you anyday
Anyday

Britney, nobody really knows you
Yet, they all think they can judge you
Although I’m not a fan of your music
The way they treat you girl, it makes me sick and
Just know that I can hear your cries
And I’d still love to get between those thighs

Because I don’t care what they all say
I’d still have sex with you anyday
Anyday

And if you want to marry me…
As long as I don’t have to sign a prenup, I agree…

’Cause I don’t care what they all say
No, I don’t care what they all say
I’d still tap that ass anyday
