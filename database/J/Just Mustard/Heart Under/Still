I’m inside it
I have been
Going backwards
Still sitting

Fall into me
Right through me
I’ve been lying
So lowly

So bitter
I’m yours
In this river
I’m yours

Can you see the
Eye so blue
Light forever
Look up to

I’m inside it
Out of mind with you
I’m inside it
Out of mind with you

So bitter
I’m yours
In this river
I’m yours
