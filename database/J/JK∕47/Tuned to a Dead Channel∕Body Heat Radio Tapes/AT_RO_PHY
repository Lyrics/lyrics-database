Atrophy.
Day comes to a close.
Family slowly disappear in nightlight blooms.
Strolling down the fourth avenue, pulling exhaust from a Turkish ...
and watching the parade of cut-off shorts and flannel shirts up and down the street.
It's an old town with old time architecture and present day streetcars.
The smell of ... is lingering.
Ignoring the casual glances and curiosities I become more ... resident.
Somewhere within the crowd, but never there.
This town's downtown is ... neon ... and amphetamines.
... nicotine ... symptomps ... emotions of what seemed years ago as ...
a voyeer, an unwanted visitor.
A "no loiter" sign is lit, ...
street ... from the mortars.
I'm walking among derelict vehicles in the jungle
... where spirits meet and in old traditions, mingle.

A stray animal, grip on the rubber band handle.
... perhaps I'm pissed,
... more to it.

Money is scarce and ... with all this Covid
The conspiracies are happening... or not.
Who gives a shit?

Everyone is arguing over bathrooms decorum politics ... entropy â€” you name it.
I'm pissed off, ... off my rocker.
Coo coo for cocoa, but too cool for school ... when it comes to junk food and ... candy, uncanny.
Binge watching ... flip-flops I'm a few books away from one-stop-shopping two kinds of a kind.
Double-fisting enchneadas
... a dimented skinhead ... in Timberlands ... skull ... two eyes over ugly skipping over ... other drunks
pissing ... scenarios ... be of who's who
when it really should be who's food.

Unhinged and undone.
... tongue in all of London.
On the lookout for late night artifacts and reflections.
Things I've done and seen.
Things you wouldn't believe.
Flashes of metal in the dark.
White letters and painkillers in the park.
Some ..., others ... mark.
Passed out with money peeking out of their skinny jeans,
don't let me start, I've seen ... and felons
with first class fabrications.
Sunken ships ... across the face.
Watching the white meat peek where the blade drips.
Delirium ... are nostalgic.
Only in one moment.
Some say it's tragic.

Black magic and white lines,
tracing memories ... across the looking glass
with the fractured reflection.
... mind, restless.
... basics.
Destroy or build, mathematical ...

Born into this, honed by this.
However, this place I haunted, it drags its feet.
... and the food is to bland to eat.
The weather never changes
and the culture smells like ass.
Everyone smokes grass
and the flags fly full-mast.
... five-percenter.
Someplace between nothing, nada, and nowhere.

Some dude ...
People speak tongue in cheek and cough into their masks.
The nightlight tastes like flat ass ...
... and the culture is a mish-mash of ...
to call this a paradise would be a misnomber
Reality is a ... too thin to grasp.
... thinking the grass would be greener on the other side.
... thinking ... by ... bribed.
I was selling ...
... American Dream in disillusion.
Creatively agitated and detached in collective consciosness ...
nothingness of the modern life
and its digital echoes.

Born into this, molded by this
... detached an analog insomniac.
Running from the fringes in the words ... ... and somewhat mnemonic.
Scratching for decent ending ... lotto ticket.
Walking in the neon shadows of a memory.
When wolves lived free in the guise of men and women instead of sleepwalking here with dreamers,
where everyone is a plate and the food is spoiled.
