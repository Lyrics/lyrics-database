Do you want to save your soul?
Take back all the things that they stole?
We won’t resurrect the crusade now
’Cause it looks like we’ve been betrayed

Will someone come
save us from this story line of mass destruction?
Will they stay when they see
what we have done just to be free?

Waiting, we’re waiting
Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero
Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero intervention
Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero intervention

The boys in charge celebrate
Their cunning game of switch and bait
Looking down at the world they’ve created
Land of the lost and sedated

Will someone come
save us from this story line of mass destruction?
Will they stay when they see
what we have done just to be free?

Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero intervention
We’re waiting for a superhero intervention
Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero intervention
Waiting, we’re waiting for a superhero intervention

I’m waiting for for a superhero

Will someone save us from this storyline?
I’m just standing here, waiting for a superhero
Will someone save us from this storyline?
I’m just standing here, waiting for a superhero

We’re waiting for a superhero
