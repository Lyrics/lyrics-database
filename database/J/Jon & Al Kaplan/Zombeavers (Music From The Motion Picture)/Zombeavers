Zombeavers

You hear your sweetheart scream
She tells you why, you don’t believe her
She saw one in the bathroom
It’s no lie, it’s a zombeaver!

Contaminated by toxic goo
A random genetic mistake
They’re semi-aquatic, they’re hungry for you
Boys and girls, stay away from the lake!

Zombeavers
Zombeavers
Zombeavers
Zombeavers

A cheerful gang of college students
Think they’re on vacation
Instead, they’re dodging beaver chompers
And facing their damnation

Don’t board up the doorways and windows, my friend
It won’t do any good
These furry brown bastards are fully equipped
And they’ll chew right through the wood

Say goodbye to your golden retriever…

Zombeavers
Zombeavers

So, brace yourself, you’ve never witnessed
Rodents quite like these
Oh, Jesus Christ, you can’t escape
They’ve blocked the road with trees!

Check your bodies for scratches, you can’t be too careful
Their claws are a cause for concern
Yes, once you’re infected
It’s only a matter of time before you turn into

Zombeavers (spoiler alert)
Zombeavers

Look out, they’re coming through the walls
Your girlfriend’s chewing off your balls

Zombeavers
Zombeavers
Zombeavers!

Zombeavers, baby
