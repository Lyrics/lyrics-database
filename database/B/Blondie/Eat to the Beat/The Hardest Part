Twenty five tons of hardened steel
Rolls on no ordinary wheel
Inside the armored car
Ride two big armed guards

In a bulletproof vest, shatterproof glass
Overdrive we’re gonna pass
Twenty five tons of hardened steel
Rolls on no ordinary wheel

The hardest part
Of the armored guard
Big man of steel
Behind the steering wheel

Nitro and acetylene
Open the machine
No short heist, no overnight
Big money take you to Brazil

Bulletproof vest, shatterproof glass
Overdrive we’re gonna pass
Time bomb, greasy mob, count down
Hurry up, come on!

The hardest part
Of the armored guard
Big man of steel
Behind the steering wheel

In a wire mesh cage with a twelve gauge
Radio, we’re coming fast
Oh, need to feel some hardened steel
Deliver the big money deal

Of the armored guard
Here’s what I heard
I’ll tell you that he will
No matter what you feel

Oh, the hardest part
Of the armored guard
Big man of steel
Behind the steering wheel

Twenty five tons of hardened steel
Deliver the big money deal
