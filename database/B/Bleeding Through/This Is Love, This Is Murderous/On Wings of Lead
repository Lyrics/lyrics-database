Nothing was supposed to hurt like this
Missing you was always one more kiss
Now there’s nothing that I can do
One more nail in the coffin, and it’s all for…

You always were and always was a simple love story
You were everything I ever hoped and dreamed
Drown me in a pool of my blood
It’s getting harder just to breathe
I’ll suffocate you faster just so you can’t see, so you can’t see me sleep
It’s getting harder just to say the right things

I’ve seen the angel’s face, and I’ve heard her sing
To me
From my reflection on this razor blade, I’ve heard ten thousand dying screams
And they’re calling me (they're calling me)

The day will break on this saddest day
So don’t let me wake
I’ve heard this all before, I’ve seen this over and over again
Don’t let me wake

Drown me in a pool of my blood
It’s getting harder just to breathe
I’ll suffocate you faster just so you can’t see, so you can’t see me sleep
So you can’t see me sleep

Oh

So you can’t see me sleep (sleep)
So you can’t see me sleep (sleep)

The day will break on this saddest day
So don’t let me wake
I’ve heard this all before, I’ve seen this over and over again
Don’t let me wake

Nothing was supposed to hurt like this
And missing you was always one more kiss
And now there’s nothing that I can do
There’s just one more nail in the coffin
There’s just one more nail, and it’s all for you

I’ve seen the angel’s face, and I’ve heard her sing
To me
From my reflection on this razor blade, I’ve heard ten thousand dying screams
And they’re calling me

The day will break on this saddest day
So don’t let me wake
I’ve heard this all before, I’ve seen this over and over again
Don’t let me wake
