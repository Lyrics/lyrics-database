[This was a fucking bomb
For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon
There was a firefight!]

Aaaaaw!
Oough!

You are the fucking disease
Another day, another memory
But I have fucking failed
I turned another lie into the work of a saint

So where’s the cure?
Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror
On their face
Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery

You won’t take me
You won’t take me
You won’t take
You won’t take

All that’s left is a bitter taste
Of a life that was once so promising
Rather cut at the wrist
Than laugh about your mistakes
Sickness still fills the air
Another life that you wish you could fake
Your eyes will cut through me, but it’s a risk
That I must fucking take
I must take!

So where’s the cure?
Hundreds of souls
With the look of horror
On their face
Now I rise from my knees
I will not live in misery

You won’t take me
You will not destroy me
You cannot destroy me
And I’ll fight you with every ounce of strength I have left
And I’ll seal it with a bullet and a kiss
So look at your fucking horror — Horror

I wanna see your face
Show me your true face!
I wanna see your face
Show me your true face!

And my heart belongs to you, so save me
Aaw!
And my heart belongs to you, so save me
For the sake to give it away

It still beats (it still beats), it still beats (it still beats)
It still beats inside of me!

And my heart belongs to you, so save me

And my heart still beats
And my heart still beats
My heart still beats, so save me
My heart still beats
