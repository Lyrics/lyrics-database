Now what do you want from me?
When I’ve sacrificed my heart so you can be set free
And time will never cure this disease
I’m only left with tired arms to stop from drowning

This
This is loveless
Love
Your love is hopeless

Now what do you want from me?
When I’ve sacrificed my heart so you can be set free

This
This is loveless
Love
Your love is hopeless

Do you remember
On that night I couldn’t find the words to say I’m sorry?
And if you recall
That night you ripped my heart right out before saying I loved you

Do you believe in this?
Do you believe in me?
If you believed in love
Would you believe in me?

So what will you take from me?
I’m the man without a soul, a soul for you to seek
And time will never cure your disease
I’m only left with tired arms to stop from drowning

This
This is loveless
Love
Your love is hopeless

Do you remember
On that night I couldn’t find the words to say I’m sorry?
And if you recall
That night you ripped my heart right out before saying I loved you

Do you believe in this?
Do you believe in me?
If you believed in love
Would you believe in me?

Believe in me!
I’ve emptied my soul
Believe in me!
I’ve killed this disease
Now time to shatter your heart
Bring you to your knees
I’ve
I’ve found the strength to fight on
And stop the bleeding — And I’ve stopped the bleeding

Do you remember
On that night I couldn’t find the words to say I’m sorry?
And if you recall
That night you ripped my heart right out before saying I loved you

Do you believe in this?
Do you believe in me?

You’re killing
You’re not the same to me now
Gotta kill to believe
