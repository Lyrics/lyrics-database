Well, I’ve been known to write a few songs
Lovin’ and leavin’ and gettin’ too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil’s always along for the ride

We ride down
To the creek by the water
I’ve been baptized by the preacher’s daughter
Lucky for me now, he never caught us though

Oh, we ride
To the bar by the levee
’85 jacked up square body Chevy
Blanket in the back for when it gets hot and heavy, oh

Oh, we ride
Pedal to the floorboard, she beggin’ for more
Sippin’ on apple pie, moonshine
And I’ll be gone by the morning light

Yeah, ’cause I’ve been known to write a few songs
Lovin’ and leavin’ and gettin’ too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil’s always along for the ride

We ride
Across state lines
Rubbin’ two nickels just tryin’ to make a dime
Hard to make a livin’ while the gas is so high

Oh, we ride
Like a Harley on a two-lane, Palomino crossplane
Drop it down to four-wheel drive on a Friday night
Crackin’ open a cold Bud Light

Oh, we ride
Pushin’ through the hard love
Lookin’ for my give-a-fuck, needle peggin 95, but that’s alright
’Cause I’m runnin’ every red light

Yeah, ’cause I’ve been known to write a few songs
Lovin’ and leavin’ and gettin’ too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil’s always along for the ride

Oh, we ride
Oh, we ride

Yeah, ’cause I’ve been known to write a few songs
Lovin’ and leavin’ and gettin’ too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil’s always along for the ride

Yeah, I’ve been known to write a few songs
Lovin’ and leavin’ and gettin’ too stoned
Bottle and a pistol by my side
The devil’s always along for the ride

Oh, along for that ride
The devil’s always along for that ride
