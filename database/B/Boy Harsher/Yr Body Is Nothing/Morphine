I

I

I wanna take you down
Lies make it hurt
You, you want the same thing
I wanna make it sting

Alone in my hotel room
Alone without a second chance
I wanna make it hurt more
I wanna make you dance

It’s like heaven
Above

It’s like heaven
Above

She’s like morphine on my mind
She’s like morphine all the time
She’s that morphine when I’m coming down
She’s that morphine when I hit the ground
She’s like morphine

I

She’s like morphine on my mind
She’s like morphine in my way

You

You

You

Lies (ah) will make it hurt
Lies make it hurt
You want the same thing

It’s like heaven
Above

I’m in heaven
Above
