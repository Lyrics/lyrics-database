I have a spell, I know it well
Dark, dark night
Pull me in

You lose the light
I lose that light
Dark, dark night
Pull me in

You say the word
That's all I ever heard
Dark, dark night
Pull me in

Pull me in
Pull me in
Pull me in
Pull me in

I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone
I'm gone

I have a spell, I know it well
Dark, dark night
Pull me in

Dark, dark night
Pull me in

Dark, dark night
Pull me in

Dark, dark night
Pull me in
