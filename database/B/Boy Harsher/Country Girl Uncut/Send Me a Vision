Send me a vision
In the middle of the night
Send me a vision
So I don't have to fight

You found out
Who I was

You found out
Who I was

Do you feel
Who I am?

Send me an angel
So I don't have to fight
Send me an angel
So I don't have to fight

Do you feel
Who I am?

Do you fear
Who I am?

Send me a vision
So at least I know
Send me a vision
So I'm not alone

You found out
Who I was

You found out
Who I was

Do you feel
Like someone else?

Do you feel
Like someone else?

Feel...

Send me an angel
So at least I know
Send me an angel
Where broken hearts go

You found out
Who I am

You found out
Who I am
