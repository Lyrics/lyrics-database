You said I was
lost
Cause you found god

Big lips all lies
Small hands
for a simple boy

In this messed up world

Oh it's time
I find
The man in me
The man in me

You had
my face
bound up
Innersexual

Blond hair
Blue eyes
Leather jacket
In the crowd of Westerners

They got the best of her

Oh it's time
I find
The man in me
The man in me

Oh it's time
I find
The man in me
The man in me

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I was

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I was

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I was

I wish, I wish, I wish, I wish
I was
