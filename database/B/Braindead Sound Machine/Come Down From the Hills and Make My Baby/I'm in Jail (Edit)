I ain’t gettin’ no new highs
I ain’t gettin’ no new highs
But I’m bummin’ some new lows
But I’m bummin’ some new lows
Hello from the half-way house
Hello from the half-way house
Where nobody you know goes
Where nobody you know goes

I’m in jail
I’m in jail

Where do all the seconds go
Where do all the seconds go
Oh so slowly one-by-one?
Oh so slowly one-by-one?
Leaning toward the darkness
Leaning toward the darkness
Nothin’ new under the sun
Nothin’ new under the sun

I’m in jail
I’m in jail

I’m in jail
I’m in jail

Everybody soltaire, everybody blue
Everybody doin’ time
Until their time is due
Nobody bustin’ out
No one to
Nobody gets an out
Until their time is due

I’m in jail
I’m in jail

I’m in jail
I’m in jail

Where do all the seconds go?
Where do all the seconds go?
Where do all the seconds go?

Where do all the seconds go?
Where do all the seconds go?
Where do all the seconds go?
