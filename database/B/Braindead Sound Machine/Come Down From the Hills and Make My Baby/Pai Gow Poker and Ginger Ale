Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back to me again

In the New Saigon
Be my Ho Chi Minh
By the zulu dawn
Come back to me again

(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)

The zulu dawn
Is in my head
We’re going home
Somewhere…

Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back to me again

Write your life
Upon a Denny’s napkin and uh…
Lay your head upon the warm-blooded highway
Take my hand and don’t be sorry
Training bras and pony-tails
Pai gow poker and ginger ale
Don’t be sorry
Training bras and pony-tails
Pai gow poker and ginger ale

The zulu dawn
Is in my head
We’re going home
Somewhere…

In the New Saigon
Be my Ho Chi Minh
By the zulu dawn
Come back to me again

(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)
(Pai gow poker)

The zulu dawn
Is in my head
We’re going home
Somewhere…

In the New Saigon
Be my Ho Chi Minh
By the zulu dawn
Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back to me again
Come back
Come back
Come back
