I go out walkin’ after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for you.

I walk for miles along the highway
Well that’s just my way of sayin’ “I love you”
I’m always walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for you.

I’ve got to see a weepin’ willow
Cryin’ on his pillow.
Maybe he’s cryin’ for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walkin’ after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just hopin’ you may be
Somewhere walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for me.

I go out walkin’ after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for you.

I’ve got to see a weepin’ willow
Cryin’ on his pillow.
Maybe he’s cryin’ for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walkin’ after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just hopin’ you may be
Somewhere walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for me.

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that’s just my way of sayin’ “I love you”
I’m always walkin’ after midnight
Searchin’ for you.
Searchin’ for you.
Searchin’ for you!
Searchin’ for you!
Searchin’ for you.
Searchin’ for you.
