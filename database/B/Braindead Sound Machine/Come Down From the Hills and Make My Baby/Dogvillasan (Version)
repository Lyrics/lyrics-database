(Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan)

Shiever the bones of the movie star dead
Come down from the hills and make my baby
Dogvillasan coyote — god from Vietnam
Come down from the hills…

(Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan)

Airplane lights like a stream of diamonds
Frozen in the sky, casts a shadow on Compton
Kick it on the porch and fire up a Camel
I’m blowing smoke rings just to dry the enamel
On my nails

Shiver my bones like the hot summer breeze
Ripples the pool, fucks up my TV
Fire up a smoke and look at the palm trees
Come down from the hills…

(Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan)

(Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan)

Come down from the hills and make my baby
And make my baby
Come down from the hills and make my baby
Come down from the hills…

Airplane lights like a string of diamonds
Frozen in the sky, casts a shadow on Compton
Kick it on the porch and come down on me
Give me something hard I can take to my grave

(Dogvillasan, Dogvilla…)

Come down from the hills…

(Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvillasan, Dogvilla…)

[We believed it then and I believe it now]
[This music is a manifestation of the rising tide of awareness on the planet]
[This music contributes to a positive environment, it feels good and it casts a comforting spell over everyone who hears it]

Come down from the hills and make my baby
