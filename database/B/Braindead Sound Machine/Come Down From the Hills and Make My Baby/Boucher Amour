What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you
What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you

I got it bad
You’ve give it good
You feed me love — it’s understood
Your love is cruel
Your love is kind
Boucher amour — you hurt my mind

(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
(The love butcher)
(Gonna rock your soul)
(Your soul, your soul)
(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
(Gonna rock your soul)

What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you
What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you

Your heart is black
My heart is blue
I’m always tried — I’m always true
My hands are tied
The cuts run deep
Boucher amour — put me to sleep

(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
(The love butcher)
(Gonna rock your soul)
(Your soul, your soul)
(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
(The love butcher)
(Gonna rock your soul)
(Gonna rock your soul)

What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you
What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you

(Heads will roll, heads will roll)

Boucher amour

Boucher amour

What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you
What you say, what you do
Doesn’t mean I don’t love you

(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
(The love butcher)
(Gonna rock your soul)
(Heads will roll, heads will roll)
