I go out walking after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for you.

I walk for miles along the highway
Well that’s just my way of saying “I love you”
I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for you.

I’ve got to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow.
Maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walking after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just hoping you may be
Somewhere walking after midnight
Searching for me.

I go out walking after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just like we used to do
I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for you.

I’ve got to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow.
Maybe he’s crying for me.
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me.
I’m lonesome as I can be.

I go out walking after midnight
I’m in the moonlight, just hoping you may be
Somewhere walking after midnight
Searching for me.

I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that’s just my way of saying “I love you”
I’m always walking after midnight
Searching for you.
Searching for you.
Searching for you.
Searching for you.
Searching for you.
Searching for you.
