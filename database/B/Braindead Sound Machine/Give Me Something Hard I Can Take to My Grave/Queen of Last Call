I will only be tempted, understand
The world I knew is no man’s land
A girl must lead by the light in her soul
This world is spinning out of control

Did it face down
In my one-eyed jack
If I lose another hand
I’ll be on my back
Laid my cards on the table
Then show my hand
I’m calling you

Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call
Better ...
I’m kicking at the last call
Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call

The world is a powerful game of chance
... keep your girl ...
I lost my juju on the roulette wheel
If I cash my chips
Then I get a new deal

Deuces face down
In my one-eyed jack
If I lose another hand
I’ll be on my back
Laid my cards on the table
Then show my hand
I’m calling you

Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call
Better ...
I’m kicking at the last call

Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call
Better ...
I’m kicking at the last call

Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call
Better ...
I’m kicking at the last call

Sick of it all
I’m kicking at the last call
Better ...
I’m kicking at the last call
