I used to like this town a long time ago
When the trees would dance in the wind
I hear the traffic breathe
No one gets to leave
For tonight the sands will come again

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

I used to swim alone
By the pleasure dome
Where the water would kiss my skin
I feel the ocean heave
No one gets to leave
For tonight the sands will come again

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tonight the sands will come again

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tonight the sands will come again

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where?

Tell me, where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tonight the sands will come again

Where is the soul?
Tell me, where is the soul?
Tonight the sands will come again
