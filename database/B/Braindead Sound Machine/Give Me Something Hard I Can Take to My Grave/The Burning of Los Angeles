Let me introduce you
To the Demon Dog Coyote Lord
Hope is a luxury
Most of you cannot afford

(Give me something hard I can take to my grave)

First and Alameda
Ventura to the Sunset Strip
All you little lemmings
Start your engines for the final trip

(Give me something hard I can take to my grave)

(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard I can take to my grave)
(Take to my grave)

Take a look behind you
With the dancing lightfire in your eyes
All you pretty people got your fifteen minutes
Then goodbye

(Give me something hard I can take to my grave)

(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard)
(Give me something hard I can take to my grave)
(Take to my grave)
