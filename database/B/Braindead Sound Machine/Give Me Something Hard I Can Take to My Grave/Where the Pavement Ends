(Ha-ha, ha-ha)
[While laying in a hospital in Long Beach, CA for eight weeks that I would do something about this problem]
(Ha-ha, ha-ha)
[Half of my right foot]
[Half of my right foot]

I'm out of love, I'm out of real estate
The door won't open at heaven's gate
I get no juju, I get no break
I'm living where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

You can steal my car
But don't you drive too far
The motor's hotter than a shooting star
It burns on voodoo, but make no mistake
You’re driving where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

I push the things I love
Out of my house
I pull the teeth of love
Out of your mouth
If I untangle my heart
Out of your hair
If I could fix this part
You know I wouldn’t care
About the hole in my life
Size of my heart
About the hole in my mind
Size of my heart
If I can make it stop
Why can't I make it start?
When I put it together
Does it fall apart?

I'm down to fumes, I'll have to stop real soon
It's too empty and it's too late
To turn it around back to another town
You’re dying where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

That’s where the pavement ends
That’s where the pavement ends

[I was on the starting line]
[... in the final run and the transmission exploded]

That’s where the pavement ends

[I was on the starting line]
[... in the final run and the transmission exploded, and it took off half of my right foot]
[I was on the starting line in Long Beach in the final run/round and the transmission exploded, and it took off half of my right foot]
[... in the final run and the transmission exploded, and it took off half of my right foot]
[... in the final run and the transmission exploded...]
