water
desert sand
until I die
I thirst
Its only getting worse
Its only getting worse

The wind
Soon come
The rain
Soon come
The end
soon come
Soon come

Soon come
Soon come
Soon come
Soon come

Soon come
Soon come

Water
It’s only water
It’s only water
It’s gonna wash it away
It’s gonna wash it away
It’s gonna wash it away
It’s only water
