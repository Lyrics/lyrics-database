I bought her from Temu
I was seventeen
I saved every paycheck
To buy the woman of my dreams

Then the box came
Said, “some assembly required”
Had to put together
My electronic wife

Oh-oh

She came with instructions
They’re all in Chinese
Can’t even read the labels
Where to put the batteries

A couple hex wrenches
Required three hours of assembly
To put together my
Electronic wife

Electronic wife
She’s driving me crazy
Electronic wife
Still trying to assemble my
Electronic wife

Now, once assembled
And the Wi-Fi is okay
Gotta wait three hours to recharge
And perform the firmware update

And when it was all over
An extended wait for a date
Time to boot up
My electronic wife

Electronic wife
She’s driving me crazy
Electronic wife
Everybody’s staring at me
And my
Electronic wife
