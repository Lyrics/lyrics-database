Well-well-well…

I wake up nice and fresh
From my deep sleep
Here in the UP
What do I see?
A bunch of tweets and posts
Some guys wondering why the ladies prefer us bears over them
I really dunno why you fellas are so surprised
What do you think we’ve been doing at your jamborees, listening to you?

She wants that bear love
She wants my hairy arms around her
To cuddle up against me when I hibernate
Your lady wants to be
Alone in the woods with me
Sorry fellas, you’ll just have to wait
