Fruit on the vine
You’ve got yours
And I’ve got mine
Meat on your bones
They won’t know
They won’t know

I love your face
Just get away
I’m on my knees
Fuck you, fuck me

I’m on my way
To feel you
Dislocate
Safe in your space
I’m open
Wide open

I love your face
Just get away
I’m on my knees
Fuck you, fuck me

(Like me, like me, like me)

I love your face
Just get away
I’m on my knees
Fuck you, fuck me
My
My
My
