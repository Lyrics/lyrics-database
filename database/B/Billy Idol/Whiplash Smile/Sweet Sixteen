Oh, I’ll do anything
For my sweet sixteen
And I’ll do everything
For little runaway child

Gave my heart an engagement ring
She took everything
Everything I gave her
Oh, sweet sixteen

Built a moon
For a rocking chair
I never guessed it would
Rock her far from here

Oh, oh, oh-oh

Someone’s built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone’s built a candy brain
And filled it in

Oh, I’ll do anything
For my sweet sixteen
Oh, I’ll do anything
Little runaway child

Well, memories may burn you
Memories grow older as people can
They just get colder
Like sweet sixteen

Oh, I see it’s clear, baby
That you are all through here

Oh, oh, oh-oh

Someone’s built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone’s built a candy house
To house her in

Oh, oh

Someone’s built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone’s built a candy brain
And filled it in

And I’d do anything
For my sweet sixteen
Oh, I’d do anything
For my runaway girl

Yeah, sad and lonely and blue
Yea, gettin’ over you
How, how do you think it feels, yeah
To get up in the morning, get over you
Up in the morning, get over you
Wipe away the tears, get over you, get over, get over

My sweet sixteen
Oh, runaway child
Oh, sweet sixteen
Little runaway girl

Gave my heart an engagement ring
She left everything
Everything I gave her
Sweet sixteen

Built a moon
For a rocking chair
Never guessed it would
Rock her far from here (rock her far from here)

Yeh, umm-hm, oh, oh-oh

Someone’s built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone’s built a candy house
To house her in

Oh…

Someone’s built a candy castle
For my sweet sixteen
Someone’s built a candy house
To house her in

And I’d do anything
For my sweet sixteen (my sweet sixteen)
Oh, I’d do anything (I’d do anything)
For my runaway child (my runaway child)

I’d do anything (anything)
Oh, sweet sixteen (oh, sweet sixteen)
I’d do anything (I’d do anything)
For little runaway girl (little runaway girl)
Little runaway girl (little runaway girl)
Oh, sweet sixteen (oh, sweet sixteen)
Oh, sweet sixteen (oh, sweet sixteen)
Oh-oh-oh (oh-oh-oh)
