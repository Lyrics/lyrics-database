Living, fighting, obsessing
Just as long as I can share it all with you

Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Come rain, come shine
Hell and back, the beginning, in-between
Till the end of time

All that shines
Turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

As above, so below
You ain’t no fool and honey, I’m damn sure that you know

Yesterday, today, tomorrow
Come rain, come shine
Hell and back, the beginning, in-between
Till the end of time

All that shines
Turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

(Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah-ah)
(Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah-ah)
(Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ah-ah)

All that shines
Turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust

All that shines
Turns to rust
All that stands in time
Turns to dust
