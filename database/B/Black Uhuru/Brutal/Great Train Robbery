New York, woah!
New York City, oh!
Da-da-daa…

New York, woah!
New York City, oh!
Da-da-daa…

Oh yeah

Terrible than the Great Train Robbery, oh-oh-oh
More terrible than the Great Train Robbery
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery, oh-oh-oh
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery

The things I’ve done in life will go down in history
In the Big Apple, the place called New York City
What’s going down? - come and report it to me
Anything going down - come and report it to me

I heard those boys planned a nearly ten million robbery, woah
Well, if they make it, they probably gotta break it
Although I wasn’t there, it was a 50/50 share
Anything going down - come and report it to me

Terrible than the Great Train Robbery, oh-oh-oh
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery, oh-oh-oh
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery

The things I’ve done in life will go down in history
In the Big Apple, the place called New York City
What’s going down? - come and report it to me
Anything going down - come and report it to me

A business got to learn, food got to eat
So brother, do it neat, cross 110th Street

And if the brothers messed it up
And don’t let me get my cut
There’s gonna be hell up in Harlem
Hell up in Harlem

Oh, woa-woah
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery

The things I’ve done in life will go down in history
In the Big Apple, the place called New York City
And what’s going down? - come and report it to me
Anything going down - come and report it to me

No good friends ever let you down, no-no-no
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery…

Ain’t gonna get me down!
You ain’t gonna let me down!
Ain’t gonna get me down, no-no
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery…

It was all planned out!

Yes we have an inside view
So we knew just what to do

It was all planned out! Oh, boy…
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery

Brothers, they respect the don
So they carry out the plan
Terrible than the Great Train Robbery

After they take the train
Next day they did lick Champagne
Money flowing down like rain…
