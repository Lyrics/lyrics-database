It always sucks refolding the kind of map
Needed when I get stuck where the sun don’t shine the fact

It’s been Buck Rogers time since I hit other than rock bottom

Even the odds of having you against me
With your crotchless jihad on blue balls evidently
Are all mighty good god, so angel dust my soul like James Brown

Street legal whore hauling so much stunning ass

Weak spot that sets the bar so low just nerve can score
With no respect, since, oddly, danger feels like pay dirt

I’m the least you could do
If only life were as easy as you

If only life were as easy as you
I’m the least you could do
If only life were as easy as you
I’m the least you could do, oh yeah
If only life were as easy as you
If only

When my fumbling breaks you should
I thank your dad for the damaged goods?

When my fumbling breaks you should
I thank your dad for the damaged goods?

When my fumbling breaks you should
I thank your dad for the damaged goods?

When my fumbling breaks you should
I thank your dad for the damaged goods?
