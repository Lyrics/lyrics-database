Sundown all around
Walking through the summer’s end
Waves crash, baby, don’t look back
I won’t walk away again

Oh-oh-oh, baby, anywhere you go
We are bound together
I begin, baby, where you end
Some things are forever

Circle in the sand, round and round
Never-ending love is what we’ve found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need

Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)

Cold wind, tide moves in
Shivers in the salty air
Day breaks, my heart aches
I will wait for you right here

Oh-oh-oh, baby, when you look for me
Can you see forever?
I begin, baby, where you end
We belong together

Circle in the sand, round and round
Rising of the moon as the sun goes down
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need

Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)

Baby, can you hear me?
Can you hear me calling?

Oh-oh-oh, baby, anywhere you go
We are bound together
And I begin, baby, where you end
Some things are forever

Circle in the sand, round and round
Never ending love is what we’ve found
And you complete the heart of me
Our love is all we need

Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand (circle in the sand)
Circle in the sand
