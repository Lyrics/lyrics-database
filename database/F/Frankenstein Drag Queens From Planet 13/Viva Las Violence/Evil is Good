Little God gave us a big black eye
And the Devil puts a stake on it and says it’s alright
They tell us we must choose a side
Well, why does the darker one seems so bright?

Well, the world’s telling us we’re doomed
And they don’t aprove of pointy hats and magic with brooms
Now I’ve got a question for you
Well, if God’s so fucking perfect, why’d he fuck up on you?

They tell us if we pray
That when we die we will go to a better place
Well, I don’t wanna do the things I should, ’cause it feels good to be evil
’Cause evil is good

Will you go to church on sunday
To wash away the shit you did the past six days?
Now you’re on your knees to pray
Well, we pray your stupid God will come and take you away

They tell us if we pray
That when we die we will go to a better place
Well, I don’t wanna do the things I should, ’cause it feels good to be evil
’Cause evil is good

Yea, evil is good!
Yea, evil is good!
Evil, evil, evil!
Evil, evil, evil!
