She looks like the moon
She says, “It’s your eyes”
She sees everything
She knows me too well

And she looks like the day
She says, “It’s the light”
Something in the way
She says, “goodbye”

And she looks like the moon
So close and yet, so far
She says everything
She knows me too well

And I can call you, “friend”
And I can be the world
Silent chatter held
I won’t be around

And I can be a friend
But I won’t be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don’t push me out

She looks like the moon
She says, “It’s your eyes”
She says everything
She knows me too well

And I can call you, “friend”
But I won’t be around
Silent chatter, bound
Just don’t push me out

We don’t have to speak tonight
Just don’t say, “goodbye”

Making a home in my body
Letting it grow in my body
Taking these chains from my body
Letting it go from my body
Letting it go from my body
Taking these chains from my body
It’s harder than you know

She looks like the moon
She says, “It’s your eyes”
She says everything
She knows me too well

And she looks like the day
She says, “It’s the light”
Something in the way, she says, “goodbye”

Just don’t say goodbye
I can be the world, tonight…
