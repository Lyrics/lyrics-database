I want to hold and kiss you in Paris
I want to hold your hand in Rome
I want to run naked in a rainstorm
Make love in a train cross country

You put this in me
So now what?
So now what?
So now what?
So now what?

I wanna know you
No, not like that
I don’t want to be your mother
I don’t want to be your sister either
I just wanna be your lover
I wanna be your baby
Kiss me, that’s right
Kiss me, that’s right

I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love

Justify

I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love

Poor is the man
Whose pleasures depend
On the permission
Of another
On the permission
Permission

I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
I want you to justify my love, my love, my love
