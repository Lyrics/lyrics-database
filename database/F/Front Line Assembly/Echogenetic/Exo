A broken picture
Stares at you on the wall
Faded memories
On how you lost it all

Now knowing
That you are all alone
Your time has gone
In this hopeless song

Today begins
Tomorrow never ends

(Loneliness) — human emotions of parody
(Forgiveness) — the only thing to set you free
(Honesty) — is everything you are to me
(Needing) — what everyone wants to be

What have I done
With all this hurt?
To end like this
In the frozen dirt?

You give your heart
Your heart and soul to me
This burning flame
You hold next to me

Today begins
Tomorrow never ends

(Loneliness) — human emotions of parody
(Forgiveness) — the only thing to set you free
(Honesty) — is everything you are to me
(Needing) — what everyone wants to be
(Denying) — we try to find our destiny
(Serenity) — descent from grace, a silent plea

We walk in silence
We fade away
We walk in silence
Nothing left to say

Unfold our hands
We slip away
We fall apart
We drift away

It’s over now
It’s over now
A ghostly glimpse
It’s over now

We slip away
We slip away (we slip away)
We fade away (we fade away)
We slip away (we slip away)
