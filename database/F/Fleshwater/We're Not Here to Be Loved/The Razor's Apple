What’s going on right now?
Is the sound of hell?
Six feet, dig it up
Blame it on yourself again

Reach in, let it out
We can shut it down
These are the symptoms of you
Making me sick of the truth

And if you ask how
We can figure out
Why we lost ourselves
So let go, calm down

I wish it was that easy
We’re all just victims
Of ourselves
Searching our way off the shelf

These are the symptoms of you
Making me sick
And it gets contagious, I’ve lost my patience
More desperate than before

How, how is it?
So they say
What’s on your mind?
How, how deserving, it’s a lie!

In the space between
Every I and you
You’ll be safe and green
’Til your lips turn blue

Reset, start again
You’ll starve again
The stars are bending to heal the pain
You can’t take away, you can’t take away

(You stop and start it) the stars are bending
(You stop and start it) to heal the pain
(You stop and start it) you can’t take away
(You stop and start it) you can’t take away
