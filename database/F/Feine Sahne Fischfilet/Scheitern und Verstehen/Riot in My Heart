I'm not going to change my mind
I can't listen to your fuckin' lies
We stand together for a free life
We will never forgive
We will never forget!
I can't listen to your fuckin' lies
We stand together for a free life
We will never forgive
We will never forget!

We will stay
We will fight -
Against the fascists
Antifa unite!

Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
A riot, a riot, a riot in my heart

This for all the comrades we lost
This is for their ideals and their dreams
This is a call to justice
We will never forgive
We will never forget!

We will stay
We will fight -
Against the fascists
Antifa unite!

Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
A riot, a riot, a riot in my heart

Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
Since you've been gone
There's a riot in my heart
