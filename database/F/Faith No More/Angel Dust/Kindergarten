Return to my own vomit like a dog
Rhymes and giggles muffle the dialogue
Carve my initials in a tree, I will never leave
Maybe one day I’ll be royalty

Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate?

Drinking fountains are shorter than they used to be
The swings on the playground don’t even fit me anymore
Folklore
Nobody’s supposed to believe in the next grade

Write it a hundred times

Kingdom
Kindergarten
Waiting
Bell’s not ringing

Held back again…

Everything got quiet suddenly; no dolby
And the theater is empty
Film is flapping on the side of the projector
The reel is over
Banished with my sticky shoes and stinging eyes

I’m walking outside

Kingdom
Kindergarten
Born late
Will I graduate?

Write it a hundred times, a hundred times, a hundred times, a hundred times
Write it a hundred times, a hundred times, a hundred times, a hundred times

Held back again…
Held back again…
