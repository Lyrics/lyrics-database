We were so happy…

Things worked out better than we had planned
Capital from boy, woman and man

We were like ink and paper
Numbers on a calculator
Knew arithmetic so well
Working overtime
Completed what was assigned
We had to multiply ourselves

A bouncing little baby
A shiny copper penny

And he spent himself
Would not listen to us
But when he lost his appetite
He lost his weight in friends

Baby became a fat nickel so fast

Then came puberty
Exponentially
Soon our boy became a million

People loved him so
And helped him to grow
Everyone knew the thing that was best
Of course, he must invest

A penny won’t do, no
A penny won’t do, no
A penny won’t do, no
A penny won’t do, no

But he made us proud
He made us rich
But how were we to know
He’s counterfeit

Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
Now everything’s ruined, yea
