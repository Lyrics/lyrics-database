Go on and wring my neck
Like when a rag gets wet
A little discipline
For my pet genius

My head is like lettuce
Go on dig your thumbs in
I cannot stop giving
I’m thirty-something

Sense of security
Like pockets jingling
Midlife crisis
Suck ingenuity
Down through the family tree

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
But without me you’re only you — (you’re only you)
Your menstruating heart
(It ain’t) bleedin’ enough for two

It’s a midlife crisis
It’s a midlife crisis

What an inheritance
The salt and the Kleenex
Morbid self-attention
Bending my pinky back

A little discipline
A donor by habit
A little discipline
Rent an opinion

Sense of security
Holding blunt instrument
Midlife crisis
I’m a perfectionist
And perfect is a skinned knee

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
But without me you’re only you — (you’re only you)
Your menstruating heart
(It ain’t) bleedin’ enough for two

It…
It…
It
It

It’s a midlife crisis
It’s a midlife crisis

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
But without me you’re only you
Your menstruating heart
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
(It ain’t) bleedin’ enough for two

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
But without me you’re only you — (you’re only you)
(Go on and wring my neck)
Your menstruating heart
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
(It ain’t) bleeding enough for two

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
But without me you’re only you — (you’re only you)
(Go on and wring my neck)
Your menstruating heart
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
(It ain’t) bleeding enough for two

You’re perfect, yes, it’s true
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
But without me you’re only you — (you’re only you)
(Go on and wring my neck)
Your menstruating heart
(Go on and wring my neck)
(Like when a rag gets wet)
(It ain’t) bleeding enough for two
