Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it’s out of reach and it’s in the dark

Sometimes I think I’m blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin’ away
But I know, there’s a picture beneath

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens…

Because I’m somewhere in between
Of my love and of my agony
You see, I’m somewhere in between

My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Layin’ face down on the ground
My fingers in my ears to block the sound
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight

Droplets of “yes” and “no”
In an ocean of “maybe”

From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline
From the top, another downhill slope of mine
But I know, the equilibrium’s there

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens…

Because I’m somewhere in between
My love and my agony
You see, I’m somewhere in between

My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

Back and forth, I sway with the wind
Resolution slips away again
Right through my fingers, back into my heart
Where it’s out of reach and it’s in the dark

Sometimes I think I’m blind
Or I may be just paralyzed

Because the plot thickens every day
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin’ away
But I know, there’s a picture beneath

Indecision clouds my vision
No one listens…

Because I’m somewhere in between
Of my love and my agony
You see, I’m somewhere in between

My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

In between
Of my love and my agony

You see, I’m somewhere in between

My life is falling to pieces
Somebody put me together

In between

Somebody put me together

In between

Somebody put me together

My life is falling to pieces
