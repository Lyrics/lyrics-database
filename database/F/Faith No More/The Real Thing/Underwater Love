Looking down into the water
It’s hard to make out your face
If our love is drowning, then why
Do I feel so out of place?

Bubbling up to the surface
Are you getting a breath of fresh air?
Forever longing to make you mine
But I can’t escape your stare…

Liquid seeps into your lungs
But your eyes look so serene
It’s wonderful how the surface ripples
But you’re perfect, and I cannot breathe

Forever longing to make you mine
But I can’t escape your stare…

Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I’ll never get enough

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

But I can’t escape

Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I’ll never get enough

Hold me closer, keep me near
My underwater love
Hold me closer, keep me near
I’ll never get enough

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go

Touch me from below
I’ll never let you go
