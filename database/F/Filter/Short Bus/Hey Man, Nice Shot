I wish I would’ve met you
Now it’s a little late
What you could’ve taught me
I could have saved some face
They think that your early ending
Was all wrong
For the most part they’re right
But look how they all got strong

That’s why I say, "Hey man, nice shot"
What a good shot, man
That’s why I say, "Hey man, nice shot"
What a good shot, man

A man
Has gun
Hey man
Have fun
Nice shot

Now that the smoke’s gone
And the air is all clear
Those who were right there
Got a new kind of fear
You’d fight and you were right
But they were just too strong
They’d stick it in your face
And let you smell what they consider wrong

That’s why I say, "Hey man, nice shot"
What a good shot, man
That’s why I say, "Hey man, nice shot"
What a good shot, man

A man
Has gun
Hey man
Have fun
Nice shot

A man
Has gun
Hey man
Have fun
Oh nice shot man

Oh
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
Oh
I wish I would have met you
I wish I would have met you
I’d say nice shot
