I can’t hear myself
Ain’t that beautiful?
I am drowned out by the roar
Floating back up from the shore
It is wonderful

It is easy, take your time
Take all day, I don’t mind
Stretch it out
For all our lives

I can’t hear myself
It is fine
I am humbled by the trees
Silenced by the bees
So right

So right
So right
So right
So right

So right
So right
So right
So right

So right
So right
So right
So right

So right
So right
So right
So right

So right
So right
So right
So right
