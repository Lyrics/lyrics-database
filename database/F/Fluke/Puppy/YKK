New night, new day
New place, new prey
New rules, new names
New ways, new games

Inside, insane
In fear, in changes
In need, in pain
In deep, enslaved

No light, no space
No signs, no state
No voice, no face
No choice, no grace

Been good, been brave
Been game, behaved
Been bad, been shamed
Been made, been tamed

Been cruel, been kind
Been tense, been fine
Been free, been tied
Seen time pass by

Been this, been that
Been out, been back
Been bold, been brash
Been cheap, been trash

Been weak, been strong
Been right, been on
Been there, been wrong
Been here too long
