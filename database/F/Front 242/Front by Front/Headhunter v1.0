Freeze, shoot!
(I, I believe)

Today he has no means, he’s alone and anonymous
But written in his cells, he’s got the marks of a genius
I’m looking for this man to sell him to other men

One: you lock the target
Two: you bait the line
Three: you slowly spread the net
And four: you catch the man

(You catch the man)
(You catch the man)

I’m looking for this man to sell him to other men
To sell him to other men at ten times its price at least
Who’s able to forget them to realize my aim

One: you lock the target
Two: you bait the line
(Bait the line, spread the net, you catch the man)
(Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net)
(And catch the man) you catch the man

Freeze, shoot to kill, or die!
Freeze, shoot to kill, or die!

(I believe, I believe, I, I)
(I believe, I believe, I, I)

I’m looking for this man to sell him to other men

(I believe, I believe, I, I)
(I believe, I believe, I, I)

Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net, and catch the man

(Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net, and catch the man)
(Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net, and catch the man)
(Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net, and catch the man)
(Lock the target, bait the line, spread the net, and catch the man)

You catch the man

(Catch the man)


(I’m looking for this man)
(I’m looking for this man)
(To sell him to other men)
To sell him to other men at ten times its price at least

Freeze!

Lock the target
(Spread the net, and catch the man)
Spread the net
(Spread the net, and catch the man)
Lock the target
(Spread the net, and catch the man)
(Lock the target)
Spread the net
(Spread the net)
And catch the man (and catch the man)
