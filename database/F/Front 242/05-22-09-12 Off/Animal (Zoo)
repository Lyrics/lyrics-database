It’s always the same
I’m the only one who’s always left to blame
Take what you can take
Hurt is your only idea of a game
To break away
I don’t have that within me
And I’m not your prey
So I bite the hand that feeds me

When all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage!

When I look in the mirror
All that I see
A zoo animal that wants to be free
Just get away, get away from me
’Cause I’ll never be who you want me to be

No!

It’s always the same
It’s not easy to keep myself contained
Sit back and relax
How can I when I’m going down in flames?

’Cause all you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage!

When I look in the mirror
All I can see
A zoo animal that wants to be free
Just get away, get away from me
’Cause I’ll never be who you want me to be

Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away

Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away
Get away, get away

When I look in the mirror
All that I see
A zoo animal that wants to be free
Just get away, get away from me
’Cause I’ll never be who you want me to be

All you do is break me
And put me
You put me in a cage!

When I look in the mirror
I just want to be free
I want to be free
I just want to be free!
