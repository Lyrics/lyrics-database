Better get ready
For the rest of my life
My soul’s too shaky
Gotta leave it behind

Well, I tell ya

(Cold turkey when I’m out of the crowd)
(A fixation with the weather below)
(Damnation from my head to my feet)
Lord, have mercy, have mercy on me

I tell ya

Strange things are happening to me
But I don’t understand the pain
Will you ever let me go?
Strange things

Light a candle for the times of old
Heaven’s burning and the world gone cold
Sad shadows in the light of day
... is all I need to stay straight

I tell ya

(Submission takes me higher and higher)
(Transmission with the freaks of desire)
(No message on my radio)
No mercy, now I’m climbing the walls

I tell ya

Strange things are happening to me
But I don’t understand the pain
Will you ever let me go?
Strange things

I don’t understand the pain
But even ... shall be
Will you ever let me go?
Strange things

Well, I tell ya

(Cold turkey when I’m out of the crowd)
(A fixation with the one and the loud)
(Subversion from my head to my feet)
Lord, have mercy, have mercy on me

I tell ya

Strange things are happening to me
But I don’t understand the pain
Will you ever let me go?
Strange things

I don’t understand the pain
But even ... shall be
Will you ever let me go?
Strange things
