I’m searching the sky
Silent, within my soul
Across this land reaching out
For the power to understand

Don’t say that you want to be saved, don’t fight
Don’t say that you want to be saved, don’t fight
Don’t say that you want to be saved
Don’t say that you want to be saved
Don’t say that you want to be saved, don’t fight
Don’t say that you want to be saved, don’t fight

Searching the night
Deep inside the shadows of sunsets
I’m just a man
Who’ll know one day a guardian angel
