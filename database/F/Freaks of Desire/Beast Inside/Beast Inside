0500 and the radio’s dead
Blindfolded baby in a hotel bed

I got up, I got up
Snake’s alive, dancing on air
I got down, I got down
Broken glass take me nowhere

(Some of us are bleeding, some are in disguise)
Makes no difference if the world goes blind
(Once I was believing, once there was a light, now!)
You ain’t seen nothing like the beast inside

Don’t hate, don’t hide
I surrender to the beast inside
Don’t pray, don’t lie
I surrender to the beast, yeah!

Got my picture in a dirty magazine
Eyes got busted in a Wild Boys scene

I got ready, ready
Make my mind dancing on air
I got high, so high
Smoking in the alley with the Blackstone Gang

(They say this kind of living is tearing me apart)
Well, spend some time with me, yeah (Oh)
(Somewhere in the distance, somewhere in the stars, now!)
I can’t feel nothing but the beast inside

Don’t hate, don’t hide
I surrender to the beast inside
Don’t pray, don’t lie
I surrender to the beast, yeah!

Get up
Get high

(Some of us are burning, some are in disguise)
Makes no difference if the world goes blind
(Once there was a believing, once there was a time, now!)
I can’t feel nothing but the beast inside

Don’t hate, don’t hide
I surrender to the beast inside
Don’t pray, don’t lie
I surrender to the beast, yeah!

Don’t pray, don’t lie
I surrender to the beast inside
Don’t pray, don’t lie
I surrender to the beast, yeah!

Now!
Now!

Now!
Now!
