You’re just too good to be true
Can’t take my eyes off of you
You’d be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much

At long last, love has arrived
I thank God I’m alive
You’re just too good to be true
Can’t take my eyes off of you

Pardon the way that I stare
There’s nothing else to compare
The sight of you keeps me weak
There are no words left to speak

But if you feel like I feel
Please, let me know that it’s real
You’re just too good to be truе
Can’t take my eyes off of you

I lovе you, baby, and if it’s quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say…

Oh, pretty baby, don’t bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you

You’re just too good to be true
Can’t take my eyes off of you
You’d be like Heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much

At long last, love has arrived
And I thank God I’m alive
You’re just too good to be true
Can’t take my eyes off of you

I lovе you, baby, and if it’s quite alright
I need you, baby, to warm the lonely night
I love you, baby, trust in me when I say…

Oh, pretty baby, don’t bring me down, I pray
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
Oh, pretty baby, trust in me when I say…

I need you, baby, well, won’t you come my way?
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, baby, let me love you
