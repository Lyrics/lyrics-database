Well, there ain’t no rock and roll
Ever since they sold out Rolling Stone
All the words that were sung in the past
Will never feel the same when we’re looking back
All the old men sitting in their make up chair
With their gold record walls really couldn’t care
All the fame feels the same when you’ve had enough
So they don’t bother standing up

And there ain’t no peace and love
Ever since the sixties kids grew up
All the drugs and the girls and the cash
After all the songs it was gone in a flash
All those bad boy rebels and the attitude
What a show, we didn’t know that none of it was true
Only self serve anti-establishment
We were all so innocent

Because there ain’t no rock and roll
And the blues has lost its soul
All the punks gave the man control
And every pop star’s bought and sold
No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll

And there ain’t no Joni, no Bob
No one stuck around for their protest job
All the stars and the big pharma whores
Shilling for a check from their corporate chores
All the actors say what they’re paid to say
While the fans take the blame
All the once cool fools that were me and you
Well, they pushed us all away (pushed us all away)

Because there ain’t no rock and roll
And the blues has lost its soul
All the punks gave the man control
And every pop star’s bought and sold
No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll

And there ain’t no Boss, no Queen
Never was a rage against the damn machine
No, there ain’t no fighter in the foo
No more rockin’ in those free world shoes
All the high strung Neil Young wannabes
Yea, their silence has been deafening
All the suits lick the boots of the government
What they sang they never meant

Because there ain’t no rock and roll
And the blues has lost its soul
All the punks gave the man control
And every pop star’s bought and sold
No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll

No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll

No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll

No, there ain’t no
Ain’t no rock and roll
