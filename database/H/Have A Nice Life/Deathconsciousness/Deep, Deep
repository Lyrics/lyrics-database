These atoms are liars
They do not realize, and we can’t blame them
Art as a means of escape
They don’t see the down-side
And that’s what takes them
Out on the floor
One stretches out its hands
Into the small of a back
And as they circle the room, and as they circle the room
Room, room, room
And as they circle the floor, one just wants it more
Well, they don’t want, anymore

You can sleep in these hollows and rivers
Exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
Jesus Christ, oh, Jesus Christ, why is love so lonely?
Why is love so lonely?

All water on earth
Evaporates into steam
And erupts from the ground
Does anyone else feel guilty?
Like I did it all m-m-m-myself
One feels a lack of love and there’s no limit
To the explosive power of this bomb
How do we reconcile our deaths?
We’d better figure it out before long

We will sleep in these rivers
Exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, why is love so lonely?
Why is love so lonely?

Well, you can sleep in these hollows and rivers
Exalt the righteous and drown the sinners
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, why is love so lonely?
Why is love so lonely?
