Sleeping in and out
Of an ice bath
No warmth, no life without
It’s too much

My arms, my legs are wood
Unconscious trees
With roots deep in the ground
We’ll all be out

An ocean ringed with tile
I know that’s not your style
But it certainly will be mine
If I can’t get this right

So please, please, please release me
Oh, please, please, please release me
Oh, please, please, please release me
Oh, please, please, please release me

Can you hear my faintest breath, is it amplified?
The number that I’ve become will put you inside
I’ve got a message that I must relay
No, I can’t delay it one more day (It’s not going well)
It is desperate, can you relate
Can you please, please relate? (I’m not holding up)
I am trapped
I’m stuck here on this bathroom floor
And I don’t have much more hope or pride
No air, no food (But I’m sure that I’m still alive)

Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
I will never need you more
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
I will never need you more
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
I will never need you more
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)

Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
(Oh, please, please, please release me)
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
(Oh, please, please, please release me)
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
(Oh, please, please, please release me)
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
(Oh, please, please, please release me)
Just open up your eyes, you dead ones (All ashes on the floor)
(Oh, please, please, please release me)
