Carved out of stone
Earth, blood and bone
They knock the mountains down
The earth’s grating sounds

They soothe the great machines
That yearn desperately
Just to lay them down
Within her gaping mouth

More than a symbol
More than I bargained for
More than a symbol
More than I bargained for

They wander ridges high
Between the earth and sky
Like spikes upon a crown
We wear upon our brow

And want is not a need
Reserved for human beings
It’s fingers on your throat
Is pain that all things know

More than a symbol
More than I bargained for
More than a symbol
More than I bargained for

An army of the golems is stalking, now, the heart’s lands
Eating all reality
Producing only dust and sand
Nothing hurts them
Nothing gets under their stone skin
And when their earthen mouths will open up
And just what words should come out but
“We wish we were dead”
