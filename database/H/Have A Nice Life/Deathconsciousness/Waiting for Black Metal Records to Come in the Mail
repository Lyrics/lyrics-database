What has become of all of us, all ceilings, all skies
Is that, the stars can swim a thousand dark miles
Before they ever see the floor again

With their backs against the wall on these last days
But then, we knew that would happen anyway

You drop that pitch-black pall
Over us, one and all, again
To propel your national machines
Giving us all the disease, but not the vaccine

A thousand tiny lives
Disappear into the black stretch
And I guess I thought I’d feel something but I didn’t
But I didn’t, yes, that’s a myth

With their backs against the wall on these last days
But then, we knew that would happen anyway

You drop that pitch-black pall
Over us, one and all, again
To propel your national machines
Giving us all the disease, but not the vaccine

I would give anything for a cool glass of water
Without this poisonous oil

No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never gonna be good enough
No, it’s never… (fuck)
No!
No!
There’s no air anywhere
It’s all money now
Wouldn’t you do the same?
