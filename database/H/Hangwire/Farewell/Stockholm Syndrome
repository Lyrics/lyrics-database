Hey, get close now
And burn the cigarette in my skin
Could you try and stop lying
To yourself?

Crucify the one you love for nothing
Nothing but your own
Everyone in your head died for nothing at all
At all

Turn away all my feels
Push me inside
The hole in your face
Don’t go panic if the child sails away

Hidden acts, ghostly words
Don’t believe the truth that comes out of his mouth
Close every padlock if he tries to escape
Even if he doesn’t

’Cause I’m a dismal man, in a good way
Yeah, his evilness will cost millions now
She’ll break my plate, she’ll sell my skin
And my soul for pennies

I will kill myself if that makes you happy
And I will drown myself in my horrible vibes
I will pay for all the bad things
You have done
