For many years we’ve been drinking beers
And you’ve been a big part of my life
But there’s something we should talk about
And it all comes back to your wife

She’s never liked me, and I still remember
How you defended me in that fight
Well, funny thing about that women’s intuition
I hate to tell you, but she was right

I’m a bad buddy, I’m a fake friend
I think we can’t hang out anymore
’Cause when I come over, I excuse myself
And head right for that laundry room door

I love to sniff your wife’s panties
I love to sniff your wife’s drawers
I love to sniff your wife’s panties
I can’t help it

You’re probably gonna beat my ass
You’re prboably gonna kick ass
I know you’re gonna beat my ass
But it’s been worth it, no regrets

You’re a good buddy, you’re a real friend
And I can’t believe things went down this way
You ran our conversation by your lovely wife
And she really told you it was okay

So I can sniff your wife’s panties
You let me sniff your wife’s drawers
I can still sniff your wife’s panties
I really love you…
