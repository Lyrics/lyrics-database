I’m living two lives
I’m high and I’m low
To my eyes
I push and I pull

Jekyll or Hyde
You’ll never be sure sometimes
Light as a bird
Doesn’t seem right

I am a gun and I am loaded
I’m taking you down, I’ll take you down
I am a bomb about to blow and
You’re going down, I’ll take you down

Breakin’ you down
I’m pounding you down
Breakin’ you down
I’m taking you down

Fillin’ your eyes
Now that you know
You’re inside
Lock in the door

You know you can’t hide
’Cause I have the key
You’ll find the beast within me
Now is the time

I am a gun and I am loaded
I’m taking you down, I’ll take you down
I am a bomb about to blow and
You’re going down, you’re going down

I’ll break you down
I’ll break you down
I’ll take you down

Breakin’ you down
Poundin’ you down
Breakin’ you down
I’m takin’ you down

Breakin’ you down
I’m takin’ you down
