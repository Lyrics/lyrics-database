We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin’ in the dark
’Cause we are, we are, we’re built from broken parts

If you can lose it all then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the marquee
And I can hold it up, but I hold it up hardly
It’s hotter here in hell but it’s gettin’ real dark, see
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
And every step, another step, you’re walkin’ on my dreams
Every breath, another breath, you’re breathin’ when I breathe

I watch them all come, gotta watch the rest go
I’m married to the devil in this city of angels
So come all you wicked to the world of the empty
I know I need it all, so baby don’t tempt me
I’m knockin’ on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checkin’ all you bitches like I’m checkin’ this check sheet
So put your hats on, Lohner don’t get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin’ in the dark
’Cause we are, we are, we’re built from broken parts

The fame’s your best friend, you love it; no questions
Beatin’ down the door is the face of rejection
And once again it’s a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessin’
But who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
’Cause stories aren’t told about the ones unseen
With the gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face; he doesn’t think he can die

So grab a pick and an axe ’cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack and we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, whatcha see now? (See now?)
Murder the monster you’ve made and watch him bleed out
We’re in a life where it’s kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I’m talkin’ to you

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin’ in the dark
’Cause we are, we are, we’re built from broken parts

(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what’s ours) Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that You gave us
(No one) From the city of angels
(No one) An empty vessel of devils
(Can take away what’s ours) Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes, see the world that You gave us

We are, we are, we are made from broken parts
We are, we are, we are broken from the start
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beatin’ in the dark
’Cause we are, we are, we’re built from broken parts

(We are, we are) From the city of angels
An empty vessel of devils
(We are, we are) Is there no one to save us?
Look through my eyes, see the world that You gave us
(And our hearts, our hearts) From the city of angels
An empty vessel of devils
(’Cause we are, we are) Is there no one to save us?
Look through my eyes, see the world that You gave us
