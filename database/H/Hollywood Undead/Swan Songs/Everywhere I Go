Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show

Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk before my mom wakes up
Break up with my girlfriend, so I can bang sluts
I’m undead, unfed, been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don’t booze it, I’m gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping
Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping

When I start drinking, my dick does all my thinking
Hoes want to be seen with me, and I like their big thick titties
D-cups with extra filling, take it out, let me lick it quickly
Calm down, it’s just a hickey
I’ll blame it on this whiskey sipping, gets me tipsy
Drink fast and enjoy your buzz, take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home, but your friends won’t let ya
I got a 40 in my Ford Fiesta
Buy beer or pay the rent, my signing bonus was quickly spent
So I’ll beat my meat like I’m a fucking butcher
And I’ll punk the pussy like I’m Ashton Kutcher

Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping
Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping

Let’s get this party jumping, let’s see some 40 chugging
I wanna see your booty rubbing against my dick when I start buzzing
Come on, girls, I wanna see you drinking
I wanna see your brain start shrinking
Make a move, I saw you winking
Drunken pussies, what I’m thinking
I don’t give a fuck if you’re drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night ’til they call the cops
Fuck a wrist band, let’s all do a keg stand
I’m like Cheech without the Chong, hitting up the beer bong
When the cops show up, they’re gonna get the finger
And I don’t give a fuck ’cause I’m the designated drinker

Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping
Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping
Let’s get this party started (what?), let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping
Let’s get this party started, let’s keep them 40’s popping (what?)
So just get buzzed, and stay fucked up, we’ll keep them panties dropping

Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show, bitch
Everywhere I go, bitches always know
That Charlie Scene has got a weenie that he loves to show
