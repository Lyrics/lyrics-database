Every breath I take recalls the wretch I once was,
The wretch I remain.
Fueled by hatred, by greed.
The inability to love a world that lets me down.

My misanthropy eats me alive.
My misanthropy eats me alive.
My misanthropy eats me alive.
My face in the dirt.
My head staring down.
My head staring down.
Staring down.

A miserable existence,
A life fueled by hate.
Now my face to the world, steadfast.

My life once miserable is now immeasurable.
My life once miserable is now immeasurable.

What can I do with a heart full of hate
Besides dig places to rest for those I love,
Besides make beds in the depths for those given up,
Besides dig places to rest for those I love.

My tattered soul needs mending
And I’m done searching.

No greater Love than this.
No greater Love.
No other Love.
