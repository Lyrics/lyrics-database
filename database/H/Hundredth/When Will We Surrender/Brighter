The night, the night is darkest just before dawn, just before dawn.
So we search for brighter days.
Trudging through fields of deceit.

This will be the day of amelioration.
If we’re granted a clear sky.

This will be the day of amelioration.
If we’re granted a clear sky.

Where we can look up and admire all that you are
Without a storm in the way, without a storm in the way.
There’s been so many storms as of late.
I know nothing but rain,
I know nothing but rain,
Nothing but rain.
Nothing but rain.

Dry up our eyes.
Nothing but rain.
Dry up our lives.
Nothing but rain.
Dry up the rain.
The storm’s inside me.
The storm is inside me.
The storm is inside me.

With so many storms around me,
It’s no surprise that when I see the sun, see the sun
I begin to squint my eyes.
I can’t handle it all at once, so I let it in slowly, and bask in my saving grace, my saving grace.

(I need Your sun to dry up the rain.)
