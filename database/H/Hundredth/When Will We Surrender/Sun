The sun rises and the sun sets
And hurries back to where it rises.
Wind to the south, and wind to the north.
Ever returning, returning on its course.

All streams flow into the sea,
Yet the sea is never full.
The streams return again without an ounce of toil.
What has been, will be again, nothing new under the sun.
There is nothing new under the sun.

Lest the adversary misunderstand our hand.
Lest the adversary misunderstand, misundertand and say our hand has triumphed.

What has been will be again.
Nothing new under the sun.
What has been, will be again to exalt flesh.
What has been will be again.
Nothing new under the sun.
What has been will be done again to exalt flesh.

Lest the adversary misunderstand our hand.
Lest the adversary misunderstand, misunderstand and say our hand has triumphed.

Remove our worthless idols.
Wreck our pride.

Remove our worthless idols.
Wreck my pride.

Remove our worthless idols.
Wreck my pride.

Kindle a fire that burns to the realm of death below.
Devour the earth and its harvests.
