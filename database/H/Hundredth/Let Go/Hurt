I hurt myself today to see if I still feel. I focus on the pain, the only thing that’s real.
The needle tears a hole, the old familiar sting. Try to kill it all away, but I remember everything.

What have I become my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end.
And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt.

I wear this crown of thorns upon my liar’s chair. Full of broken thoughts that I cannot repair.
Beneath the stains of time the feelings disappear. You are someone else. I am still right here.

What have I become my sweetest friend? Everyone I know goes away in the end.
And you could have it all. My empire of dirt. I will let you down. I will make you hurt.

If I could start again, a million miles away, I would keep myself. I would find a way.

I will let you down. I will make you hurt. I will let you down. I will make you, I will make you hurt.
