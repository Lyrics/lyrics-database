Carry on. Overcome.

The lies that floods our compromise. The day is getting darker.
Your past that fuels the pain inside. You can rise above it.
If you’ve fallen to your knees, don’t give up just yet.

We will overcome anything and everything standing in our way.
Let go of all the things that keep us from pressing on.

Lift your head from the soil, lift your head from the toil. Breathe in life and move forward.
Breathe in life and move forward.
Breathe in life and move forward.

Set apart to succeed beyond what we can dream.
Watch us rise. Watch us rise! We will shatter negativity.
Watch us rise. Watch us rise! We will shatter negativity.

’Cause we were made for more.
I know that we were made to overcome anything and everything standing in our way.
Let go of all the things that keep us from pressing on.

Lift your head from the soil, lift your head from the toil.
Breathe in life and move forward.
Breathe in life and move forward.

In the wake of the one’s we lost, we’ll let their legacy live through us.
We’ll carry on, while we watch everything go wrong, go wrong.

Carry on, I will overcome the world.
Carry on, I will overcome the world.
I will overcome.
