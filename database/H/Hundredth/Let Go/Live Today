I’m gonna live today, live to make a change.
There comes a time in every life when it’s time to move on.
And well hey, that’s what it is today. That’s what it is today. It’s time to make a change.
I was never awake, just dreaming of the days when things were said and never done.
But now this is the life I lead, only to breathe hope into humanity.
But I made, I made a promise, I made, I made a promise to myself.
I promised I’d never go back to thinking of this place as my wishing well.
It’s the same ol’
take,
take,
take,
I gave up on the world and that’s all I could give.
And I said I’ll never go back to putting myself above the rest.
I held my chin up high, but that’s all I could lift.
Inside of me,
Inside of me,
Was a void,
Was a void,
As empty,
As empty,
As the sky without the sun,
Empty as the
sky without the sun.
sky without the sun.
I was never awake, just dreaming of the days when things were said and never done.
But now this is the life I lead, living only to breathe hope into humanity. I’m gonna live today.
