On a bridge across the Severn on a Saturday night,
Susie meets the man of her dreams.
He says that he got in trouble and if she doesn’t mind,
He doesn’t want the company.
But there’s something in the air,
They share a look in silence, and everything is understood.
And Susie grabs her man and puts a grip on his hand
As the rain puts a tear in his eye.

She says
“Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life
Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life”

Driving through the city to the Temple station,
He cries into the leather seat.
And Susie knows her baby was a family man,
But the world has got him down on his knees.
So she throws him at the wall, her kisses burn like fire,
And suddenly he starts to believe.
And he takes her in his arms and he doesn’t know why,
But he thinks that he begins to see.

She says
“Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life
Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life
Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life
Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life”
(wonderful life)

She says
“Don’t let go
Never give up…
Don’t let go
Never give up,
It’s such a wonderful life”
Wonderful life (wonderful life), wonderful (wonderful), wonderful life.
Wonderful life (wonderful life), wonderful (wonderful), wonderful life.

“Don’t let go”
“Don’t let go”
