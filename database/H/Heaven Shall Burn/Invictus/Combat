Welcome to a world of pain
This is the day of your conversion, mortification
Dragged away from home on blood red nights
Slave to a brutal system, forevermore, forevermore

You are an orphan now, adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come

No more will you meet a smilling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears

Constrained and forced to kill
These cruelties will haunt you, a life in combat
Your fear will make you bleed, your inner combat
A life without a future, you will forget your wishes
And nothing to embrace, but the rifle in your hands, forevermore

You are an orphan now, adopted by the beast of war
The end of all your childhood dreams has come:
A life of combat, forevermore

No more will you meet a smilling face
Now peace has left your sleep forever
There are no arms to hold you
Yet there are no hands to wipe your tears away
There are no arms to hold you
Peace has left your sleep

"There are about 300.000 child soldiers worldwide, most of them are forced to fight in armed conflicts."
