An unforgiving chill crawls down my blood stained limbs
And a thousand frozen bodies line our way into the night
Shadows of dead trees appear like ghosts in poisoned clouds

Heart-wrenching cries agonize my soul
Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell
We’re wandering like shadows
Through frozen worlds

Once my mind was occupied,
Filled with heroic stories, all glorious tales about this war
But now I know there is no honor here to find
We’re marching endlessly, relentlessly, towards the end
A purgatory we walk through, a common grave for all of us
No matter friend or enemy, a forest of the dead

Heart-wrenching cries agonize my soul
Hand to hand we fight
And man by man we die
No sanity is here to find, our god has left this hell
We’re wandering like shadows
Through frozen worlds

I should not care about my enemies, tell me what have I become
My blackened heart’s still beating
All of a sudden I’m aware
Compassion is no weakness, compassion is no treason
