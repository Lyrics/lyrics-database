Golden domes and massive towers
False icons, show their perfect smiles
All joy and benefactions, they give it with a smile
Big hearted deeds and wise words
They donate it all with pleasure

As you have paid the price
Wise words of advice
You should pay the price

Insignia of doubtful unions
An untruth factory, the Jesus industry

A preacher in a palace, deriding Luther’s fight
Jugglers rise to icons, fiddlers playing saints
Selling hope and worship mammon
Blindness, fear, delusion - their trinity
As you have paid the price, welcome to paradise

Insignia of doubtful unions
An untruth factory, the Jesus industry

Disbelievers, greed and wastage
Joel is gonna burn in hell

These disbelievers in a preacher’s suit
Success and happiness they sell
Accountants save your soul
As you have paid the price, welcome to paradise

I don’t know about all sins and sinners
But Joel’s gonna burn in hell

Insignia of doubtful unions
An untruth factory, the Jesus industry
