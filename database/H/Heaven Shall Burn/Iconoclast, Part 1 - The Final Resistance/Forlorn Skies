Forlorn skies
Their blank eyes stare into a forlorn sky
Disgraceful figures stumble through the mists
Sons of their nations, lost generations
A tragedy beyond imagination

Burnt by the sun, drowned in the rain
Buried alive in this cold, scorched earth

No glory left to find
They all have met their demons
They all have stopped to cry
We’re dying for no reason
Forlorn skies
We’re dying for no reason

… no reason
… for no reason

The day they marched into this abyss
Wantoness and confidence affended us
And flowers blazoned our doom
We lost our dreams
We lost our dreams

These withered hearts are waiting for the end
Those who return, will never leave this hell again

No glory left to find
They all have met their demons
They all have stopped to cry
We’re dying for no reason
Forlorn skies
We’re dying for no reason

A merciless horizon
does not promise any hope
Father versus father
Brother against brother
A tomb for all humanity

No glory left to find
They all have met their demons
They all have stopped to cry
We’re dying for no reason
Forlorn skies
We’re dying for no reason
