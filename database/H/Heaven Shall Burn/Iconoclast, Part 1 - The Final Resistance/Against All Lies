They walked and walk among us
And carry on their vile convictions
Education is prevention
This is our struggle, this is our strife

We took just a fight
We were saved and accepted this endeavor
To open eyes, enforce memento, to awake remembrance
It didn’t start with carnage
Demolition of all human rights

Against all lies
And versus their oblivion
There will be justice, despite all unconcern
We will find them, for all this apathy
Against all lies we seek for justice
We seek for justice not revenge

No one will stop us, nothing they can do
Blunt trueness will be told
And we will make it heard

Against all lies
We’ll make them face their felony
Against all lies
They will meet responsibility
