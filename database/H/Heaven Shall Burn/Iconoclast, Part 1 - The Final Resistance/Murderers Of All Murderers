Irresponsible and unreflecting
Displacing human sense into the afterworld

Running after faint beliefs, where you just have to feel
Conceive suspicion, distrust your faith

Ah!

Degeneration, dislocation and always hunting for the ones to lead you
No aspiration, no ambition

The one you hope for, the one you wait for
Lies in a long forgotten tomb
Condemned and murdered
Revealed and tortured
We have killed him
We have killed him, you and I
We have killed him, you and I

Endless drifting with the stream
And there will be no way to solace

We’ve raised ourselves to gods
We drank the seas and wiped horizons
Just everything we loved has bled to death by our knives

The one you hope for, the one you wait for
Lies in a long forgotten tomb
Condemned and murdered
Revealed and tortured
We have killed him
We have killed him, you and I
We have killed him, you and I

A deed, that’s just too great for us
There is no atonement
And no forgiveness there will be

No atonement
And no forgiveness there will be

No forgiveness
No forgiveness there will be

The one you hope for, the one you wait for
Lies in a long forgotten tomb
Condemned and murdered
Revealed and tortured
We have killed him
We have killed him, you and I
