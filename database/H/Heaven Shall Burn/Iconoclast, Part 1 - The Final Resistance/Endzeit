Nothing, just nothing,
Nothing will wipe this heart out
And no one, just no one, no one will break this frontline
We are, we are, we are the final ones
We are, we are the, we are the final resistance

We’re fighting to the last
Driven by the hate evoked in us
No one will surrender
A storm will break the silence
This storm will break the silence

Nothing, just nothing, nothing will wipe this heart out
We are, we are the, we are the final resistance

This vengeance is justice and justice will be done
your end is our triumph and the day will come
A reign of terror, an age of horror, nothing will remain
A promise to the fallen, we’ll make them feel our pain
A promise to the felons, you’ll never rise again

We take it back
We take it all back
We take it back
We take it all back

This vengeance is justice and justice will be done
your end is our triumph and the day will come
A promise to the fallen, we’ll make them feel our pain
A promise to the felons, you’ll never rise again

Nothing, just nothing,
Nothing will wipe this heart out
And no one, just no one, no one will break this frontline
We are, we are, we are the final ones
We are, we are the, we are the final resistance.
