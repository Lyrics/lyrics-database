you all have seen the suffering
you all knew it, you all know it
but your eyes lie to your heart
morality corrupted and profit conducted

born in a factory
cold steel machineries
and driven by this greed - you’re breeding this disease
infected by this deadness - you’re breeding this disease

but I will not accept your carelessness
mass production - mass destruction
you will face relentless changes!
