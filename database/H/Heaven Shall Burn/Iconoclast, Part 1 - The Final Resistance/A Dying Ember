These darkened days and restless nights
Are passing by like never ending years
What is left for me to keep me bearing
Up against this pain
Buried deep inside my soul

And all that’s left are memories
These pictures of unworried days
But no one’s there to save my legacy
It will just perish, fade with me

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
A dying ember

There is my god to carry me,
But in this world, I needed you

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
And my bright eyes still realize your apathy
My heart beats strong, it still beats strong

There is my god to carry me
But in this world, I needed you

What is left for me to keep me bearing up against this pain
There is no god to ease this pain

No one awaits me, nothing diverts me
This withered body is no empty shell
And my bright eyes still realize your apathy
My heart beats strong, it still beats strong

Nothing to live for
Nothing to fight for
And emptiness fullfills my days

All my hope, a dying ember

Nothing to live for
Nothing to fight for
And emptiness fullfills my days

Just promise me
promise me to hold my hand
