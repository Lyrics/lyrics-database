Their shadows burnt into the walls
So many lives reduced to ashes
So many homes razed to the ground
A shine like from a thousand suns

Betrayed by their proud leaders
And executed by atrocious enemies
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt should rise

A thousand books all full of vindications
Simple explanations, coloured declarations
Where silent sense of guilt should rise
But a victor’s story cannot lie

Betrayed by their proud leaders
So many homes, so many lives
A silent sense of guilt should rise

One modest truth they teach their children
Again, a victor’s story cannot, it can not lie!

See these branded generations
Hear, their bells are tolling
Hear, hear them calling
