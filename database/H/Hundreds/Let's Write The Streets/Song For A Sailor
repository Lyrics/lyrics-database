Is this the last meeting place?
Will you find me inside the haze?
And will you come?
Will you come?

While you are searching me, my work is done
Please tell nobody that I am real
They will run over you
It will never heal

You must forget
You must forget

Lies this in between certain kind of regret

I see them side to be wide
On the birds of the flowers

I will not move
But the wind is blowing
In the fields

I see them side to be wide
On the birds of the flowers

I will not move
But the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing
In the fields

And in the end you came to late
Let’s talk to my hair
I guess that’s a fate
I will grow fast
The highest tree in the field
You bark up at last

I close my eyes,
Recognize your steps at the meadow

I will make a single noise
In my lovely cave

I close my eyes,
Recognize your steps at the meadow

I will make a single noise
In my lovely cave
