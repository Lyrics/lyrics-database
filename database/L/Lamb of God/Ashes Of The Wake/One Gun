The sins of deliverance

The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
It’s when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new independence day
They’ll hallow your name
They’ll hallow your name for your sacrifice

The sins of deliverance

"So let the wicked perish in the presence of God"
For your sacrifice

The sins of the father atoned by the son
Confessions of commitments broken
A nail driven for every one
It’s when murder is justice that martyrs are made
A one-gun salute for the new independence day
They’ll hallow your name
They’ll hallow your name for your sacrifice

You are the cause, I am the effect
Created in hatred, a noose for your neck

The eyes of the patriot fixed through the scope
The unknowing tyrant walks to the rope
They’ll hallow your name for your sacrifice
They’ll hallow your name
Sacrifice…
Sacrifice…
Sacrifice…
They’ll hallow your name
