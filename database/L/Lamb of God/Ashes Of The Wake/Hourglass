Privileged
A chosen few
Blessed with our time in hell
Witness a divine vision
The day we all fell still
Rapture of the dying age
A shattered hourglass
Wrath of the warring gods and so this too shall pass
It’s only getting worse
Not worth a moments regret
Each dawn another curse
Every breath a twisting blade
What will be left behind in the ashes of the wake

An ill wind blows this way
The edge of the envelope burns
Forbearance and my vengeance
Payment for your intent
Fear and death in the wings
In thrall of those fallen from grace
Petty is as petty does
Witness the mass disgrace
God forbid you read the signs
Watch for meanings between the lines

Gehenna has now arrived
No hindsight for the blind
Your trust has been misplaced
Believed the lies told to your face
Became another casualty and now it’s too late
You finally made it home
Draped in the flag that you fell for
And so it goes
The ashes of the wake
Its only getting worse
