Endless mornings cut by the dawn razor
Whipping the nightmares to a froth
Endless questions with no answers
No replacement for what’s been lost
Lost

Everything suffocates in the dust of past
Fortunes squandered
The empire of lies to whom you pandered

Suffer a self-imposed exile
Taste the bitter fruits of denial
In the presence of greatness
The humble can only bow

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of eternal winter

Tell me a lie with the best of intentions
Mute in the age of mass communication
Dark days lead to darker nights
Frozen, out of time
It dies for blessed ego
The once mighty laid low

Frost on the breath of life
Empty of warmth or light
Full of nothing but deprivation
Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

Full of nothing but deprivation
Eternal winter

You taught me hate
I’ll teach you fear
Open the eyes
Kill despair

You tried to squeeze the life from me
Son of a bitch, I’m going to break you
Son of a bitch, I’m going to break you
Break you, I’m going to break you (break you)
