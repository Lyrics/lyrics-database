Witness shame’s parade
The pain of blame repaid
It’s fucking hopeless
Accusations and denial

Hopeless
Demon of another day
Colorless
Stoned
Solid gray

Emptiness
Of promises I made
So faithless
The tenants long betrayed

Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept

Familiar touch
A ritual to numb the cut
Salvation in vice
Anguish is realizing what could have been
But never was
It’s emptiness that fills the cup
Devotion in the method of my fall

Pointless
Futility continuing
Endless
Flowing in corrupted vein

Walk the faded line
Cursed crawl of time
Silence
The only promise ever kept
It’s fucking hopeless

Hopeless
