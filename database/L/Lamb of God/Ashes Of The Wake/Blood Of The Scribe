All of this comes crashing down
Cornerstone’s gone
Sleepless
Hopeless
No end in sight

Ink well
Has run dry
Fill it with
Blood of the scribe

Rest comes easy to the guiltless…
The vampire laments as he prays for the sun.
Doom, despair, tragedy are the tools of the trade

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Frayed at the edge, flat lined
The anvil cracks, the hammer
Relentlessly comes down
A new pariah is born

Cut to the bone, rob the grave
Unearth the stone, lay to waste
Defile the tome, rip the page
Strip mine the vein, lay to waste

Chastisement lays you down to sleep
Tucks you in with bloody kisses
Gifts of nightmares bitter sweet

Type A negative shuts me down
Catch phrase will be death of me
Is this not what you came to see?
What, are you not entertained?

Climb the walls ’til nails bleed
Rip the hair, tear the seams
Break the glass, head in hands
Bell tolls endlessly, no end in sight
