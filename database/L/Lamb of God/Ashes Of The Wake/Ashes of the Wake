We killed a lot of innocent civilians.
To us every civilian in Baghdad was a terrorist.
They said "they are now in civilian clothes" that makes everybody free game,
But if they came in our perimeter, we lit ’em up.
And when we would pull the body out, and when we would search the car, we would find nothing.
This took place time and time again. No harm, no foul, that’s okay, don’t worry about it,
Because this is a new type of war, this is an eradication.

I honestly feel we’re committing genocide over here,
I don’t believe in killing civilians, and I’m not going to kill civilians for the United States Marine Corps.
