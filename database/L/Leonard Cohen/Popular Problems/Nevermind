The war was lost, the treaty signed
I was not caught across the line
I was not caught, though many tried
I live among you, well-disguised

I had to leave my life behind
I dug some graves you’ll never find
The story’s told with facts and lies
I had a name, but never mind

Never mind, never mind
The war was lost, the treaty signed
There’s truth that lives and truth that dies
I don’t know which, so never mind

Your victory was so complete
Some among you thought to keep
A record of our little lives
The clothes we wore, our spoons, our knives

The games of luck our soldiers played
The stones we cut, the songs we made
Our law of peace which understands
A husband leads, a wife commands

And all of these expressions of
The sweet indifference, some called "love"
The high indifference, some call "fate"
But we had names more intimate

Names so deep and names so true
They’re blood to me, they’re dust to you
There is no need that this survives
There’s truth that lives and truth that dies

Never mind, never mind
I leave the life, I left behind
There’s truth that lives and truth that dies
I don’t know which, so never mind

I could not kill the way you kill, I could not hate
I tried, I failed
You turned me in, at least you tried
You side with them whom you despise

This was your heart, this swarm of flies
This was once your mouth, this bowl of lies
You serve them well, I’m not surprised
You’re of their kin, you’re of their kind

Never mind, never mind
I had to leave my life behind
The story’s told with facts and lies
You own the world, so never mind

Never mind, never mind
I live the life I left behind
I live it full, I live it wide
Through layers of time you can’t divide

My woman’s here, my children, too
Their graves are safe from ghosts like you
In places deep, with roots entwined
I live the life I left behind

The war was lost, the treaty signed
I was not caught across the line
I was not caught, though many tried
I live among you, well-disguised
