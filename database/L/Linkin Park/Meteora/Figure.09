Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It’s like nothing I could do would distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again
Because from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn’t realize, instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you

Hearing your name the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I’d see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing’ myself to them and every day
I regret saying those things because now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away, never goes away

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you

It never goes away, it never goes away
It never goes away, it never goes away

Get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know
I’ve let you go
So get away from me
Give me my space back, you got to just go
Everything comes down to memories of you
I’ve kept it in but now I’m letting you know
I’ve let you go

And now you’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be right here
You’ve become a part of me, you’ll always be my fear
I can’t separate myself from what I’ve done
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you
I’ve let myself become you, I’ve let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me, I’ve let myself become you
