I’mma be that nail in your coffin
Saying that I softened, I was ducking down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don’t have the patience; before you even say it, I know

You let your pride or your ego talk slick to me, no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell you?
I’m not the failure, I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to
Push me to let you know you can’t intimidate me

You disrespect me so clearly, now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it’s over
Now, let me show you exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself
You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself!
You did it to yourself!

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
