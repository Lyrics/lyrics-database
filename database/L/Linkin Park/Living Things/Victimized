No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
’Cause I won’t wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you

Victimized, victimized
Never again victimized
Victimized, victimized
Never again victimized

They’re acting like they want a riot, it’s a riot I’ll give ’em
As the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain’t scared of your teeth, I admire what’s in ’em
You been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you’re hidden
But the truth is, you don’t have the stomach to get ’em
Go on already, hit ’em, yeah, you gotta be kidding
Wanna talk about a victim? I’mma put you there with ’em

Victimized, victimized
Never again victimized
Victimized, victimized
Never again victimized
No
