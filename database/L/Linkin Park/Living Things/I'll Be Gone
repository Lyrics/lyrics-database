Like shining oil, this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I’m trying not to think what I’m leaving, now
No deceiving now, it’s time you let me know, let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now, bittersweet
And ’cross that horizon, this sun is setting down
You’re forgetting now, it’s time you let me go, let me go

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone

And tell them I couldn’t help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there’s nothing left can stop me

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow, I’ll be gone, I’ll be gone
I’ll be gone!
