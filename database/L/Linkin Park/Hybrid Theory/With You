I woke up in a dream today
To the cold of the static and put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering I’m pretending to be where I’m not anymore
A little taste of hypocrisy
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake, slow to react
E-even though you’re so close to me
You’re still so distant and I can’t bring you back

It’s true the way I feel was promised by your face
The sound of your voice painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me
I’m with you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
When things go wrong I pretend that the past isn’t real
I’m trapped in this memory
And I’m left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
So even though you’re close to me
You’re still so distant
And I can’t bring you back

It’s true the way I feel was promised by your face
The sound of your voice painted on my memories
Even if you’re not with me
I’m with you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No!
No matter how far we’ve come
I can’t wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far we’ve come, I
I can’t wait to see tomorrow
With you

You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With you
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
