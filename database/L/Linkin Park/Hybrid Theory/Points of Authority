Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
And puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can’t run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won’t last

You love the way I look at you
While taking pleasure in the awful things you put me through
You take away if I give in
My life, my pride, is broken

You like to think you’re never wrong
(You live what you’ve learned)
You have to act like you’re someone
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want to share what you’ve been through
(You live what you’ve learned)

You love the things I say I’ll do
The way I hurt myself again just to get back at you
You take away when I give in
My life, my pride, is broken

You like to think you’re never wrong
(You live what you’ve learned)
You have to act like you’re someone
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want to share what you’ve been through
(You live what you’ve learned)

Yo, yo
Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can’t run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won’t last

Forfeit the game
Before somebody else
Takes you out of the frame
Puts your name to shame
Cover up your face
You can’t run the race
The pace is too fast
You just won’t last

You like to think you’re never wrong
(You live what you’ve learned)
You have to act like you’re someone
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want someone to hurt like you
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want to share what you’ve been through
(You live what you’ve learned)

You like to think you’re never wrong (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you’ve learned)
You have to act like you’re someone (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want someone to hurt like you (Forfeit the game)
(You live what you’ve learned)
You want to share what you’ve been through
(You live what you’ve learned)
