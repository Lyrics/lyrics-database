Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here is not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia’s all I got left
I don’t know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

It’s like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that I watch every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall (And watches everything)
So I know that when it’s time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid, looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin

I know I’ve got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You’ve got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia’s probably worse
I don’t know what set me off first
But I know what I can’t stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can’t add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall (And watches everything)
So you know that when it’s time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin

It’s like I’m paranoid, looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin

It’s like I’m paranoid looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

(The sun)
It’s like I’m paranoid, looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin
(I feel the light betray me)

(The sun)
It’s like I’m paranoid, looking over my back
It’s like a whirlwind inside of my head
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
(I feel the light betray me)
It’s like I can’t stop what I’m hearing within
It’s like the face inside is right beneath my skin
