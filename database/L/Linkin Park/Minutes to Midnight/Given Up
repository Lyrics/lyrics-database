Wake in a sweat again
Another day’s been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I’ll never leave this place
There’s no escape

I’m my own worst enemy

I’ve given up
I’m sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I’m suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

I don’t know what to take
Thought I was focused, but I’m scared
I’m not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help, somehow, somewhere
And no one cares

I’m my own worst enemy

I’ve given up
I’m sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I’m suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me

God!

Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my misery!
Put me out of my…
Put me out of my fucking misery!

I’ve given up
I’m sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I’m suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me
