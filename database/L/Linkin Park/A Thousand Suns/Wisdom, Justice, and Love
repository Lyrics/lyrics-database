I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight
Because my conscience leaves me no other choice
A true revolution of values will lay hands on the world order and say of war
This way of settling difference is, is not just
This business of burning human beings with napalm
Filling our nation’s homes with orphans and widows
Of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into veins of peoples normally humane
Of sending men home from the dark and bloody battlefields
Physically handicapped and psychologically deranged
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
Cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love
