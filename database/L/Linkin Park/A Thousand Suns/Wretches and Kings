There’s a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part
You can’t even passively take part
And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you’ve got to make it stop

To save face, how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you don’t know
Static on the way, make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven’t yet heard
Wanna take what I got, don’t be absurd
Don’t fight the power, nobody gets hurt
If you haven’t heard yet then I’m letting you know
There ain’t shit we don’t run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

So keep pace, how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don’t know
Fire on the way, make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And I’m running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I’m at
Somewhere in-between, the kick and the hi-hat
The pen and the contract, the pitch and the contact
So get with the combat, I’m letting ’em know
There ain’t shit you can say to make me back down no
So push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go

Steel unload, final blow
We the animals, take control
Hear us now, clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

Steel unload, fire blow
Filthy animals, beat them low
Skin and bone, black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you

From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high
Front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put ’em up real high

When the operation of the machine becomes so odious
Makes you so sick at heart, that you can’t take part
You can’t even passively take part
And you’ve got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels
Upon the levers, upon all the apparatus
And you’ve got to make it stop
And you’ve got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it
That unless you’re free
The machine will be prevented from working at all
