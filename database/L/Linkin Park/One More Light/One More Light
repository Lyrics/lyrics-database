Should’ve stayed, were there signs, I ignored
Can I help you, not to hurt, anymore
We saw brilliance, when the world, was asleep
There are things that we can have, but can’t keep

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone’s time runs out
If a moment is all we are
We’re quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out
Well I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen, one more chair than you need oh
And you’re angry, and you should be, it’s not fair
Just ’cause you can’t see it, doesn’t mean it, isn’t there

If they say
Who cares if one more light goes out
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone’s time runs out
If a moment is all we are
We’re quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out
Well I do

(Well I do)

Who cares if one more light goes out
In a sky of a million stars
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone’s time runs out
If a moment is all we are
We’re quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out
Well I do
Well I do
