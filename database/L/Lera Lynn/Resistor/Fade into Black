I remember a night when I couldn’t talk right
I could hardly stand without a hand
Weak-kneed I let it bleed, your arrow deep within
I wonder when we’ll feel that way again

Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me wishin’ this was more
Like what I’d dreamed of
Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me waitin’ on your love

I remember a time when I felt alive
We somehow got by just gettin’ high
Indeed we failed to read
The fading between the lines
We just rolled on through
Like we were blind

Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me wishin’ this was more
Like what I’d dreamed of
Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me waitin’ on your love

Will you wonder how we don’t know
How to get back
Say you don’t wanna know
Clear the smoke, clear the show
Fade into the black
Where do you want to go
How are you gonna know
How to get back
Say you don’t wanna know
Clear the smoke, clear the show
Fade into the black

Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me wishin’ this was more
Like what I’d dreamed of
Don’t leave me hangin’ on your love
Don’t leave me waitin’ on your love
