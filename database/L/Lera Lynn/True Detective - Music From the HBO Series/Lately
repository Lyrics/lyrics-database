Lately I’m not feeling like myself
When I look into the glass I see someone else
I hardly recognize this face I wear, when I stare into her eyes I see no one there
Lately I’m not feeling like myself

Lately I’ve been losing all my time
All that mattered to me slept my mind
Everytime I hit another town, strangers appear to lock me down
Lately I’ve been losing all my time

The mystery that no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?

Lately words are missing from now on
Vanished in the haze of love gone wrong
There’s no future, there’s no past, in the present nothing lasts
Lately someone’s missing from now on

The mystery no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?

The mystery that no one knows
Where does love go when it goes?
