Waking up is harder than it seems
Wandering through these empty rooms of dusty books and quiet dreams
Pictures on a mantel speak your name
Softly like forgotten tunes just outside the sound o’ pain

Weren’t we like a pair of thieves with tumbled locks and broken codes?
You cannot take that from me — my small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren’t we like a battlefield locked inside our holy war?
Your love and my due diligence — the only thing worth fighting for

Change will come to those who have no fear
But I’m not her, you never were the kind who kept a rule book near
What I said was never what I meant
And now you’ve seen my world in flames, my shadow songs, my deep regret

Weren’t we like a pair of thieves with tumbled locks and broken codes?
You cannot take that from me — my small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren’t we like a battlefield locked inside our holy war?
Your love and my due diligence — the only thing worth fighting for
