Waking up is harder
Than it seems
Wandering through these empty rooms of dusty books and quiet dreams
Pictures on a mantel
Speak your name
Softly like forgotten tunes just
Outside the sound o’ pain

Weren’t we like a pair of thieves?
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You cannot take that from me
My small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren’t we like a battlefield?
Locked inside a holy war
Your love and my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for

Change will come to those who have no fear
But I’m not her, you never were
The kind who kept a rule book near
What I said was never
What I meant
And now you’ve seen my world in flames, my
Shadow songs, my deep regrets

Weren’t we like a pair of thieves?
With tumbled locks and broken codes
You cannot take that from me
My small reprieves, your heart of gold
Weren’t we like a battlefield?
Locked inside a holy war
Your love and my due diligence
The only thing worth fighting for

The only thing worth fighting for
