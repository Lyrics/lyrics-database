You were alone and you were alive
Among the walking dead
He was a liar, but not a tone
Still he went to your head

He said, “I love you baby
like a miner loves gold,
and this will never grow old”

Lost in the ether, down in the blind
And not a word was said
But he was neither vicious or kind
As he laid there and bled

His hands were on you and it felt just the same
As when he didn’t know your name
He said, “I love you baby
like a miner loves gold,
and this will never grow old”

Darkness for cover, a church in ruins
There’s nothing left to feel
Goodbye lover, this is your doing
A heart against the will
