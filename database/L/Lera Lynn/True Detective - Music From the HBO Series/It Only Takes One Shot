My bed is now a cylinder of steel
Cold and hard and shiny
To match the way I feel
The dust in here is like a burning wind
Black as coal and thunder
Dark as all my sins

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

You were there
To see me beg and kneel
What kinda man would ask me then
If he could make a deal?
When lovers of the future read these lines
A sound of steel and thunder
Will echo in their minds

I took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

Took it for a long, long time
And a woman can take a lot
Two can be undone by three
But it only takes one shot

Ashes become speed
And turn to blood
Itâ€™s strange to see
How sharp and clean
The things that come from love
