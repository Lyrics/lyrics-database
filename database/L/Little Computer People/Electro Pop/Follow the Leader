Look into the future
And you’ll understand why
People tempt this feeling
We’re going to rise high
Electromagnetics
And it’s all about
A new generation
Inventing a new sound

Look into the future
And you’ll understand why
People tempt this feeling
We’re going to rise high
Electromagnetics
And it’s all about
A new generation
Inventing a new sound

Follow the leader
Follow the leader
Follow the leader
