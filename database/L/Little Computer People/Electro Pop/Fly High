I empty the bottle
Very quick
I get me a new one
You say I’m sick

There’s no need to cry
I know why
But that’s my life
And I’m happy with it

I’m happy with it

I lick the paper
You ask me why
Oh, I see colors in the sky
I can fly

I fly so high
I like swimming in the sky
I fly so high
Yea, I can fly

Yea, I can fly
