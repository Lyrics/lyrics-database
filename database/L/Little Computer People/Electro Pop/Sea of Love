In the sea of love
I know secrets
The lie is a lie
The true is the truth

In the house of love
Life is life
There’s no guilty
Because of the truth

In the time of love
Time stand still
Moment of feelings
I want to be real

In the name of love
I will survive
It keeps me alive
I love you

(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)

In the sea of love
I know secrets
The lie is a lie
The true is the truth

In the house of love
Life is life
There’s no guilty
Because of the truth

In the time of love
Time stand still
Moment of feelings
I want to be real

In the name of love
I will survive
It keeps me alive
I love you

(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)

(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)
(In the sea of love)
