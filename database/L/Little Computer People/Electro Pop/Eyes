Look into your eyes
Look into my eyes
I've been looking into your eyes
You've been looking into my eyes

Look into your eyes
Look into my eyes
I've been looking into your eyes
You've been looking into my eyes

(Look into your eyes)
(Look into my eyes)
(I've been looking into your eyes)
(You've been looking into my eyes)

(Look into your eyes)
(Look into my eyes)
(I've been looking into your eyes)
(You've been looking into my eyes)

Look into your eyes
Look into my eyes
I've been looking into your eyes
You've been looking into my eyes

Look into your eyes
Look into my eyes
I've been looking into your eyes
You've been looking into my eyes

(Look into your eyes)
(Look into my eyes)
(I've been looking into your eyes)
(You've been looking into my eyes)
