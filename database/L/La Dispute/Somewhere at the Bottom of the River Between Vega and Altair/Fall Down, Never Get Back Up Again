Out where the stones lay like bones by the ocean
Out where the waves crash contempt on the land
Someone was trembling for fear of the tempest
Somebody silently reached for their hand

Said, "Understand that if you’re cold, I’ll keep you warm
And besides, there’s so much beauty in a storm
So come down with me to the shore
And what’s more? I adore you

So tell me, what is there to fear?
You think some seraph up above
Is trying to rob us of our love
Because the sky’s not clear?
My dear, you know there’s not
Now, listen to the rain upon the rooftop"

But the wind picked up

Out where the stones stand up like thrones beside the ocean
Out where the waves make a grave of the sea
The lovers struggled in the middle of the tempest
And water angrily crawled up onto the beach

Said, "Hold my hand, and stay with me, we’ll be released"
But the tide clung like an anchor to her feet
And though he tried to make the water line recede
It pulled her out into the sea

He could not break apart the waves
To bring her safely back in
He watched her hand break through the surface once
Then disappear again

Forever wait inside the sea for me
My dear, I hear you
You speak in every curling wave
And sing in every violent breeze
Someday not far away from here
My dear, I swear I’ll see you
And we will hear the seraphs cry
They will still envy you and I

How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I
How they envied you and I
