I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn’t keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I think I saw you in my sleep, darling
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every broken promise
That your body couldn’t keep
I think I saw you in my sleep

I thought I heard the door open, oh no
Thought I heard the door open but I only heard it close
I thought I heard a plane crashing
But now I think it was your passion snapping

I think you saw me confronting my fear, it
Went up with the bottle and went down with the beer and
I think you ought to stay away from here
There are ghosts in the walls and they
Crawl in your head through your ear

I think I saw you in my sleep, lover
I think I saw you in my dreams, you were
Stitching up the seams on every mangled promise
That your body couldn’t keep
I think I saw you in my sleep
