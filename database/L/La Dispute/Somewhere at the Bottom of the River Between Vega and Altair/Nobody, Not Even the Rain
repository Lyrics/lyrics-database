I know that someday you’ll be sleeping, darling
Likely dreaming off the pain
I hope you’ll hear me in the streetlights humming
Softly breathing out your name
I know that even with the seams stitched tightly, darling
Scars will remain

I say we scrape them from each other, darling
And let them wash off in the rain
And when they run into the river
Oh no, let the water not complain
I swear that even with the distance slowly
Wearing at your name

Your hands still catch the light the right way
And our hearts still beat the same
And our hearts still beat the same
