I’ve come here as a man in shambles
Worn out from begging on my knees
Please, I’m just trying to keep my family together
Now when you saw your lover
Wore a ring around her finger
Why didn’t you stop?

I have half a mind to make you hurt
To make you bleed, to make you suffer
I swear, if you’ve touched her
Oh heaven, forgive what I would do
To you, you monster
Think about your children
They’ll never believe what you’ve done

Listen, I am begging you
Back off
Let me rebuild all the things that you shattered

She meant it
I swear that she meant it
She whispered so often
"Husband, I’ll always be here with you"

Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always
Always is valueless
I wish I’d never heard her speak a word

And I hope you see us
Your wife and your children and I
Buried in the wreckage of your crime
While you’re laying down your sins
Softly leaning in to kiss your guilt goodnight

She is mine, she is, she is mine
You stole her, somehow tricked her but
We’ll survive, we will, we’ll survive
She loves me dearly, you’ll see, she
You are blind, you are, you are blind
She loves me, dearly loves me, she

Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe in, breathe in
Breathe

He finally paused to take a breath
Then looked down
It felt like staring into hell
The man was seated in a chair
Before him, silent
A statue framed in pain and flesh

He thought, "Oh, what more can I say
To sway him?
To make this statue speak?
I swear he’s made of stone and I
Am barely stirring up a breeze"
I’m barely stirring up a breeze

And after waiting
In this silence, finally
He finally turned around to leave
Broken and barely through the doorway
Breathing slowly
Beating hard, he heard him
Speak

"I guess love’s a funny thing
The way it fades away without a warning
It doesn’t ask to be excused
And when it’s gone, oh, it’s gone
And it ain’t ever comin’ back

There is nothing you can do to save it
To make it breathe the way it did
When you were sliding on the ring
Trust me, it’s gone for
Good

Now there is nothing you can do to stop me
She is happy when she is with me and I am
I am finally alive
I’m sorry"
