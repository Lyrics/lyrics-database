You strike while the iron is afire
You gotta love at the height of your desire
You gotta breathe while the air is sweet
You gotta ride to beat the heat

I hold my breath but I won’t bet my life on it
Sun sets west so I know where I’m going
I hold my breath but I won’t bet my life on it
Sun sets west so I know where I’m going, going
Going, going, yeah-yea-ye

You strike while the iron is afire
You gotta love at the height of your desire
You gotta breathe while the air is sweet
You gotta ride to beat the heat

I hold my breath but I won’t bet my life on it
Sun sets west so I know where I’m going
I hold my breath but I won’t bet my life on it
Sun sets west so I know where I’m going, going
Going, going

O-oh, yeah

You won’t get the best of me, you won’t hold me down
You won’t leave when I’m trying to get out of town
You know I hold my breath but I won’t bet my life on it
Gotta go
