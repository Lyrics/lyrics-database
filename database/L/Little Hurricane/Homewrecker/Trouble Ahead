They come and they burn the grass to the seed.
Everyone learns the sound of their feet.
They’ll take what you earn or they steal what you keep.
They’ll shut down the roads, blockade the sea
Yeah they will

Watch out behind, trouble’s coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Look out behind, trouble’s coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.

The trees will all burn, ash falls like leaves.
The storm’s growing cold, we can feel it in our knees.
They’ll plan when you’re calm or they’ll scheme while you sleep.
They’ll look you in the eyes while they chain your hands and feet.
Yeah they will

Watch out behind, trouble’s coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Look out behind, trouble’s coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.

Watch out behind, trouble’s coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Watch out behind, trouble’s coming.
Look up ahead, start running.
Watch out behind, trouble’s coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.
Look out behind, trouble’s coming.
Watch up ahead, start running.
