I’ll be your thief in the night so I can steal you.
I’ll be your church where you pray so I can heal you.
I’ll be your lover where you lay so I can feel you.
I’ll be your sunlight in your day so I can see you.

Oh, you’ll be my life when I am dead,
I’ll be your calm in the storm ahead.

You’ll be the beat in my heart, when there is none.
You’ll be the air in my lungs, when my breath is done.
You’ll be the tears I can’t cry, when you’re weeping.
You’re my only reason to keep from sleeping.

Oh, you’ll be my life when I am dead,
I’ll be your calm in the storm ahead.
Tell my woman that I try
To stay close, still by her side.

You’ll be my life when I am dead,
I’ll be your calm in the storm ahead.
Tell my woman that I try
To stay close, still by her side.
