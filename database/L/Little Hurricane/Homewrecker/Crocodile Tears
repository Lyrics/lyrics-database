(I’ll blow you a kiss from across the room)
I’ll let it miss so you don’t assume

(Please tell me that you want me and need me)
Doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me

(I have no one to call me "baby")
It sure is sad no one calls you lately

(I try to run but I don’t know how to get there)
Keep on running, you’re going nowhere

And you fear the sunrise will dry your eyes
Your crocodile tears

(I just need a man who will stay)
You can save it for a rainy day, ye

(Won’t you help me get my life on track?)
I’d oblige but you stabbed me in back

(Ride with me, I’m headed south)
I can’t believe a single word from your mouth

(You and me are like biscuits and gravy)
Now I know that you’re crazy

And you fear the sunrise will dry your eyes
Your crocodile tears, yea

I can’t believe a word you say
But you can save it for a rainy day
Well, hard to say not once, but twice
No, you won’t take your own advice
