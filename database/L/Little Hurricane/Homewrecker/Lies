When you’re with me baby,
I see right through your lies
When you’re with me baby,
Oh, I see right through your lies

I’m not talking about last summer,
Not talking about the fall, no
Yea, you fooled me once,
But now you don’t at all

When you’re with me baby,
I see right through your lies
When you’re with me baby, yeah,
I see right through your lies

Oh, I’m not talking about last summer,
Not talking about the fall, no
Yea, you fooled me once,
But now you don’t at all

Hey!
