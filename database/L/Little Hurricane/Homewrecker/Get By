We hold our heads high when the rain comes down
It’s been a long day but now it’s done
You’re all I need
All day
All night
What we don’t have we don’t need

Get by
Oh, we get by
With all we need to survive
We get by

Oh, I lived in the city
I’ve lived in the trees
Do what I want
Oh, I do what I please
Your holiday is everyday for me
Oh, the sun is shining
Shining down for free

Get by
Oh, we get by
With all we need to survive
We get by

Get by
Oh, we get by
With all we need to survive
We get by
