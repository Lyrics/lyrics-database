How clean must the sand be
Beyond the tea trees?
It’s in my blood
To need these things
So take me there
I’d like to go
To a lonely, crowded shore
Where the swell curls over and over
Toss me in the waves today, today
And I’ll beg the tide to wash it all away
Take my flesh, take my bones, I’ve no use for them anymore
And when they’re gone
Maybe then I’ll feel okay
Maybe then I’ll feel okay

How clean must the sand be
Beyond the tea trees?
It’s in my blood
To need these things
So take me there
I’d like to go
To a lonely, crowded shore
Where the swell curls over and over
Toss me in the waves today, today
And I’ll beg the tide to wash it all away
Take my flesh, take my bones, I’ve no use for them anymore
And when they’re gone
Maybe then I’ll feel okay
Maybe then I’ll feel okay

And is it rеally so strange
To feel the sting of change?

Toss me in the waves today, today
Maybe then I’ll feel okay
Feel okay, feel okay

Toss me in the waves today
