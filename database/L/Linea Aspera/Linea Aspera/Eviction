You know it doesn’t mind
how much you need them alive:
everything,
everything that breathes
has to die.

Union leads to severance,
the body is your residence,
temporarily rented,
so easily evicted.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

Everything that breathes
has to die.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

It’s just a matter of time, it’s just a matter of time.
It’s just a matter of time, it’s just a matter of time.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

It keeps you warm,
it keeps you warm
at night.
But if it breathes,
if it breathes
it has to die.

Union leads to severance,
the body is your residence,
temporarily rented,
so easily, so easily evicted.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

It’s just a matter of time, It’s just a matter of time.
It’s just a matter of time, It’s just a matter of time.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.

To love,
to love,
to love is to lose.
