The pain’s instinctual;
I might be trained but I just won’t dig you up.
The scale is temporal;
I have the spade but I just won’t dig you up.
You buried yourself in acid soil,
you buried yourself in acid soil.
And bones dissolve,
and bones dissolve.

We were waiting for the stones to fall,
we were waiting for the stones to fall,
we were waiting for the stones to fall,
and cities crumble,
cities crumble.

The city is melting.

While you buried yourself in acid soil,
and bones dissolve,
and bones dissolve.

The city is melting.

And all this time we were dreaming, and all this time we were numb,
while I was digging a hole I could sleep in,
I was digging a hole just for fun.

We were waiting for the stones to fall,
we were waiting for the stones to fall.

And all this time you’re complacent,
and all this time you have gained,
while I was digging a hole I could sleep in
to swallow the taste of the rain.

We were waiting for the stones to fall,
and cities crumble,
cities crumble.

The city is melting.

While you buried yourself in acid soil,
and bones dissolve,
and bones dissolve.

The city is melting.

You sought to own and have it all,
but the future’s gone,
the future’s gone.

The city is melting.

'Cause you buried yourself in acid soil,
and bones dissolve,
and bones dissolve,
bones dissolve,
bones dissolve.
