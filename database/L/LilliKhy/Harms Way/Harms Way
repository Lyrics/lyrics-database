Don’t touch your eyes
They’re too precious
And oh, when they smile it’s infectious
Don’t, you’ll go blind
You’re too perfect
A moment in time isn’t worth it

I’m waiting
Alone in the dark
For someone to save me from myself
Harm’s way
Never is so far away
When it’s in the palm of your hands

Don’t cut your thighs
Don’t be reckless
Don’t listen to them
They’re just jealous
Please realize you’re still learning
Even if right now you’re hurting
Yourself

I’m alone in the dark and no one can save me
But myself
Harm’s way
Never is so far away
When it’s in the palm of your hands
My head is racing
With thoughts of the color
It makes when my mascara runs
But instead I’ll stay
Taking deep breaths filling my chest
With better things than that heaviness

Don’t touch your eyes
They’re too precious
And oh, when they smile it’s infectious
Don’t, you’ll go blind
You’re too perfect
A moment in time isn’t worth it
