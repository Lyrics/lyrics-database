Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…

Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…

Yesterday is gone forever
Tomorrow will never be here
So live for today

Days, they come and go so fast
You sometimes wonder how long they are going to last

Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…

Forever

Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…

Wasting time, and you would see
How you can lose the precious time
So dear to me

Aah-ah…

Yesterday is gone forever
Tomorrow will never be here
So live for today

Aah-ah…

Every day is a beautiful day
Don’t waste the time doing things you wouldn’t like to do

Aah-ah…

Every day is a beautiful day
Don’t waste the time doing things you wouldn’t like to do

Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…

Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
Aah-ah…
