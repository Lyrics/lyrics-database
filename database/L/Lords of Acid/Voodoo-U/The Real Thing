2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before

It’s the turn of the century
New Year’s Eve of ’99
And we’re all anticipating
What could happen overnight
It’s a crazy situation
Gotta find myself a man
Who can lead me to temptation
And take me by the hand

Turn my dreams into the real thing, baby
Turn my dreams into the real thing

2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before

Our bodies all entangled
In a grip of ecstasy
When eleven turns to midnight
I’m gonna feel that lovin’ heat
I want to feel the good vibrations
That you put inside my head
Let’s return this for the last time
On this bed

Turn my dreams into the real thing, baby
Turn my dreams into the real thing

2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
2000 brings you more
Strange days not like before
