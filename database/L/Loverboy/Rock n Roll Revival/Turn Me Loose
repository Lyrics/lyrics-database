I was born to run
I was born to dream
The craziest boy you ever seen
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

And I was here to please
I’m even on my knees
Making love to whoever I please
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

And then you came around
Tried to tie me down
I was such a clown
You had to have it your way
Or no way at all

Well I’ve had all I can take
I can’t take it no more
I’m gonna pack my bags and fly my way
Or no way at all

So why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

Why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
I wanna fly

I’m here to please
I’m even on my knees
Making love to whoever I please
I gotta do it my way
I gotta do it my way

And when you came around
You tried to tie me down
I was such a clown
You had to have it your way
Well, I’m saying no way

So why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

Why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
I wanna fly, oh yeah

So why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
Or no way at all

Why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
I gotta do it my way

Why don’t you turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
I gotta do it my way
I wanna fly

Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
Turn me loose
