I wanna take you on a roller coaster
I wanna tell you that I’m feeling closer

I wanna push it right over the line
I wanna push it right over the line
The line that you draw as you draw me near
The line that you draw as you draw me near

I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I wanna see you far behind…
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I wanna see you far behind…

I wanna take you on a roller coaster
I wanna tell you that I’m feeling closer

I wanna push it right over the line
I wanna push it right over the line
The line that you draw as you draw me near
The line that you draw as you draw me near

I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I wanna see you far behind…
I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I wanna see you a superstar…

I wanna see you a superstar…
I wanna see you far behind…
I wanna see you a superstar…
I wanna see you far behind…

I wanna see you
I wanna see you far behind…

I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want
I wanna see you far behind…
