Is this life, this degredation
Pointless game, humiliation
Born to die, we’re born to lose
Not one choice we make we chose

And when this life is at an end
We find that death’s our only friend
Must we suffer through your games, oh Lord?
Can God really be so bored?

We spend our lives destroying, hating
Beneath our flesh a skull lies waiting
Blind to beauty, blind to love
We fear our loving Lord above

Some live their lives to play their games
Some live as victims, gone insane
Your experiment’s failed, and I trust
That when we meet you will forgive us

It’s futile, so I’ll end this note
And find a knife and slit my throat
And come to track you down, oh Lord
You better watch your back, be sure

That when we meet you’ll be surprised
No loving praise, no glee-filled cries
Just pain and hate and tear-filled sighs
And the question in the end is “why”?

A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
A letter to God
Fuck you!
