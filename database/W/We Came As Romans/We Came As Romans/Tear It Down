I’ll tear it down
I’ll tear it down

You flew way too high, way too close to the sun
Feel the power that you’re falling from above
Another tale of failed ambition
Greed and wealth feeding your addiction

What’s it like to wear a crown of dirt
Selling all those lies with a stupid smirk
What’s it like to live the life of greed
Buying everything that you want in play

Don’t get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetime
(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You’re know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetime

Wings took you up
But your selfish and you don’t know when to stop
Keep repeating the failed ambition
Affluence fueling your dependence
What’s it like to wear a rusted crown
When you know your name will never resound
What’s it like to be king for a day
When you know they won’t even remember your face

Don’t get too comfortable up in the sky
Your mistakes, they all come with a price

(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetime
(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You’re know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetime

You know you did this to yourself
Your only focus was on your wealth
Now you flew too close to the sun
You’re outdone now I’m gonna break you down

Overthrow the crown
Now I’m gonna break you down
Overthrow the crown
Overthrow the crown

(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom built on lies
(You know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetime
(I’ll tear it down) Kingdom of demise
(You’re know it won’t) Stand the test of time
(I’ll tear it down) Crown of filth you built
Won’t stand for a lifetimee

I’ll tear it down, Kingdom built on lies
I’ll tear it down, crown of filth you built
I’ll tear it down, kingdom of demise
I’ll tear it down, crown of filth you built fell down
