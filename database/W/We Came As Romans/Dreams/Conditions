We were designed for more.
In an image not our own.
But we’ve fallen short.
I’m quite speechless and was quite unaware.
Of what the capabilities of a weak heart are.
We’re cast away.
It’ll run through the back of your head until you regain control again.
The sleep lost on these thoughts wasn’t worth the time.
We’re cast away until we regain control again.
This year of you held near or not at all.
It wasn’t worth the wait.
We’re all cast away.
We were designed for more.
In an image not our own.
But we’ve fallen short.
We were so close.
It’s just not worth it to stay in this state.
It’s just not worth it to keep it.
It’s just not worth it to let it go.
I believe in a better condition.
In one that I have yet to attain.
I believe in a better love.
In one that has yet to change.
The love that I feel from my brothers is the sun in the sky.
I will find my condition in that which is unconditional.
Conversation.
Ours are never, you are ever so convincing they’ll get better.
It’s just not worth it to stay in this state.
I believe in a better condition.
In one I have yet to attain.
I believe in a better love.
In one that has yet to change.
Fill me with faith.
I won’t be cast away.
