Why do we love only when it’s convenient to us?
Why do we love only when it’s convenient to us?

It is because we don’t want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?
Too unbearable to even let the thought surface.

There are greater rewards in stepping outside of your own comfort
That there are in never breaking down the walls that you’ve built.

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one
Why do we love only when it’s convenient to us?

Why are we understanding only when it’s agreeable?

It is because we don’t want to let go
Of the security that a close heart holds?
Or is it the risk of being broken?
Too unbearable to even let the thought surface.

There are greater rewards in coexistence
That there are in never breaking down the walls that you’ve built.

A solely self-sustaining life is surely a hollow one
Why do we love only when it’s convenient to us?

It’s time to take action
It’s time to stay inspired
It’s time to prove that we aren’t all talk
And we’re not afraid of the risks.
