Stupid
Stupid

What do you do?
How do you know
What you must have
To cause a fall
Down to the core?

If all he needs
A little thought

Stupid
Stupid
Stupid

Not everything
Is what it seems
It’s only what’s said — not what is done
A thousand miles above the ground

Ah, ah, ah

Stupid
Stupid

How do you hear?
What do you see?
Just what a fucking waste of breath

What do you think
That it means
When all there’s left is thee?

Stupid
Stupid

How do you hear?
What do you see?
Ah what a fucking waste

What do you think
That it all means
When all there’s left is thee?

Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid

Not everything
Is what it seems
It’s only what’s said — not what is done
Six thousand miles above the ground

Stupid
Stupid
Stupid
Stupid

What do you do?
How do you know?

What do you do?
How do you know?

Stupid
Stupid
