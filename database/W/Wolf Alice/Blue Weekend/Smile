I ain’t afraid though my steps appear tentative
I scope it out then I throw myself into it
I ain’t ashamed in the fact that I’m sensitive
I believe that it is the perfect adjective
I wear my feelings on my sleeve I suggested it
It serves me better than to swallow in a sedative
I am what I am and I’m good at it
And you don’t like me, well that isn’t fucking relevant

Don’t call me madm there’s a difference, I am angry
And your choice to call me cute has offended me
I have power there are people who depend on me
And even you have time you wish to spend on me
I know you all think I’m unhinged
But wind it up and this honey bee stings
Did you think I was a puppet on strings?
Wind her up and this honey bee sings!

Ah
Sun and the shine
Ah
Smile

If you want me, you can find me at the bar
Lost souls congregate at the bar
Take a minute and remember who you are
Sip your drink, sip one more and you’re a star!

Ah
Sun and the shine
Ah
Smile

Ah
Sun and the shine
Ah
Smile
