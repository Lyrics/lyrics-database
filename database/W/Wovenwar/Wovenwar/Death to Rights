I watch the wonder creeping over all the walls we’ve made,
(A tragic sly cascade)
And I watch it flood away the light from any candle’s flame,
(With wick entwined of late)
Can’t keep a fire in rain.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it’s death to rights.

Sooner or later we will find new winds to carry home,
(The hearts we turned to stone)
And i pray theyre strong enough to weather gems from cindered coal,
(That you have left to smoke)
Burned out before the stoke.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it’s death to rights.

How many will we leave wondering?
How many will we leave wondering?

It starts we never finish and ends we never start,
How many lives will break upon our callous hearts,
Will break upon our callous hearts.

And the worst of it all is that you know me,
And you know that I will fall for it every time,
When we collide it’s death to rights.
