I’m watching them all fly by,
Reaching the greatest heights my dreams find,
I’m needing first a leap to climb.

I await the day the stars won’t seem so far away,
And greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay,
But until then, until then.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of ’all the horizon sends winds to take me home.

I’ll build my throne from broken bones,
Defeats I’ve known and deeds ive left untold,
My story is the storm.

I await the day the stars won’t seem so far away,
And greet a sun the darkened clouds have kept at bay,
But until then, until then.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of ’all the horizon sends winds to take me home.

I’ve seen them shine seen them rise and fall,
Yet kept my course and fared through it all.

My wings they unfold in a storming gale,
The tempest calls for my flight to fail,
When gravity beckons with its hold,
In spite of ’all the horizon sends winds to take me home.
