I am a monster inside a man
The outer shell is my better half
Methods of madness have no end
When you hunt the dead
An urge, strong urge I can't resist
And they will only set me free to run again
I am a wolf a killer alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity, a true mistery
The wolf will strike again
My dreams will prey on you
I promise this will set you free

Close your eyes and wait for it
The warm crimson freedom
Will wash you clean
Your body will rot beneath the concrete
I am a wolf a killer alone I stand
All you see is my mask of sanity a true mistery
The wolf will strike again
