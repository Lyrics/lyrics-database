Tonight, tonight, tonight
Go

Tonight is ours
Give me your passion
Tonight is ours
Give me your heart
Tonight is ours
Now and forever
Tonight is ours
We bleed tonight

Live out your dream
With everything you have inside you
This world can't hold us back forever

We bleed tonight is ours
Give me your passion
Tonight is ours
Give me your heart
Tonight is ours
Now and forever
Tonight is ours
