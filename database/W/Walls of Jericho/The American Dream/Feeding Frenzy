The smell of day, youre infect the worst, whats this sometimes, you get nothing in retire, youre noth’ frier frier for us, the regets one, between my am, whats that, the world forever gone.

For spending all youre lies, for you we walk this time (I’ve got this time) forbidden this
These’ nothing to be, nothing to be Nothing, I just peek they We’re got to pain got to pain Got To.

Sincerer day, for stain my braight, for signs without nothing eyes
Chepp it and sets to wright, youre noth’ frier frier for us, the regets one(the regets one), between my am, whats that, the world forever gone.

Everyone who take youre lies, for you we walk this time (I’ve got this time) forbidden this
These’ nothing to be, nothing to be Nothing, I just peek they We’re got to pain got to pain Got to,
Eye for youre rejects, you’re name what you pay, all of me
Forbidden this

These’ nothing to be, nothing to be Nothing.

For ’cept me all your lies, everything you sad you lie, inside this straight good fight.
’cause you will balk this torn!
Eye, forbidden this
These’ nothing to be, nothing to be Nothing, I just peek they We’re got to pain got to pain Got to
Eye for youre rejects, you’re name what you pay, all of me
Forbidden this
These’ nothing to be, nothing to ne Nothing (these’ nothing to be, nothing to be Nothing, I just peek they, you’re name what you pay, all of me).
