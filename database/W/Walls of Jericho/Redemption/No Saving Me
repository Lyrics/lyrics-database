Inside these broken lines a disruption of our lives
Insanity kicks in and all I see is another dead end
So close your eyes and escape from what you hide

How long will I take to bleed, there’s no saving me
How far will you go to hold on

I’m better off cutting my own throat, in hope for once that you might hear me
I know I can at least count on the mess never judging me
I’m breaking out from all I’ve come to be

Alone I’ve gone through hell and back to try to fell
And there is no saving me…
