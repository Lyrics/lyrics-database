Time, your time
It fades away
I feel my time
My life runs out

So hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

So hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

Dance agian
With me and we
Will find an end
For all I call

So hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

So hold…

Leaving, leaving…

So hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

Hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

Hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon

So hold your darling, your darling
In your arms
Because it leaves
Very soon, so soon, so soon

So soon

So soon
