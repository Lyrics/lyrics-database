Angel, come to me, to me, come to me.
Angel, belong to me, to me, belong to me.
Angel, you have wings, to fly, fly to me.
Angel, do you doubt? No need to have doubts.

Angel, feel my love, my love for you, feel my love for you.
Angel, carry me, to you, to your home, to paradise.
Angel, I would lie for you, for you, just for you, with my yearning heart.
And angel, I would die for you, for you, just for you, with my burning heart.

Angel, don’t feel liable for me and my pain, don’t feel liable.
’Cause angels must be free, high up from this world in eternity.

Angel, I could clip your wings to catch all your love, to calm your pain.
But Angel, this would be so wrong, you would bleed to death immediately!
So Angel, come to me, heal my glaring pain voluntarily.

I love you.
