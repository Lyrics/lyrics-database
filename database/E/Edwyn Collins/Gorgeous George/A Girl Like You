I’ve never known a girl like you before
Now just like in a song from days of yore
Here you come knocking, knocking on my door
Well, I’ve never met a girl like you before

You give me just a taste, so I want more
Now my hands are bleeding and my knees are raw
’Cause now you got me crawling, crawling on the floor
And I’ve never known a girl like you before

You made me acknowledge the devil in me
I hope to God I’m talking metaphorically
Hope that I’m talking alegorically
Know that I’m talking about the way I feel

And I’ve never known a girl like you before
Never, never, never, never
Never known a girl like you before

This old town’s changed so much
Don’t feel like I belong
Too many protest singers
Not enough protest songs
And now you’ve come along
Yes, you’ve come along
And I’ve never met a girl like you before

It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah
It’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright, yeah, it’s alright
