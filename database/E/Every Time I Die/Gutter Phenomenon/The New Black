Baby,
you got me all wrong.
And maybe,
I’m not all down and out
I’m high and I’m in.

Don’t you know who I am?
I’m the jaded one with pop insensitivity.
When I finish struggling,
we can make our way to the dance floor,
and stand like strangers,
in an elevator stuck between stories.
I always find myself in the middle of your stories.

With the cameras as a witness I will suffer!

If everything I do is wrong then, by God, I’ll do it right.

We don’t dance no, no, no…
We got class!
No, we don’t have any fun at all.
It’s the new style and we know it!
We’re not stunning, we’re just stunned!

We’re lying for a living!

Don’t you know who I am?
I’m the real thing with low-key sensibilities.
I don’t need what I’ve got,
half as much as everyone covets it!

Well, if loving me is wrong then goddamn you do it right.

It turns us on to turn you down!
We’re turned on to turn you down!
