Yes, you keep me in motion
Circling planets will never stop
I’m in the canalización and now
I’m coming to the top

There’s a train that goes backwards
And a will to survive
I feel like walking on razorblades
Black spots cover my life

Feel the move
Start to groove
As I fade
You should know that I never wait

For somebody
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody

I fell in love with my killer
This is hijacked emotion
Throwing kisses with a machine gun
In the name of devotion

And you feel good in your prison
How long is that going fine
Out in the critical distance...
I can make the rules of the game

Feel the move
Start to groove
As I fade
You should know that I never wait

For somebody
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody

Feel the groove
Start to move
As I fade
You should know that I never wait

For somebody
Somebody
Somebody
Somebody

Somebody
Somebody
Somebody

Somebody
Somebody
Somebody
