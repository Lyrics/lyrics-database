The silvern light, a stannite glow
The primal night of the darkened vault
Under the welkin dark, solemn chants will soar
The immemorial, songs of the wise
To declare the rise of the night-born
Of glinting dew and susurrant winds
Of a vibrant dawn, long foreshown
And your pristine face pours down crystal rays

Caressed by your velvet touch, as we dance through the night
One last silver kiss, as the ancient song falls silent

The wolves from Antumnos come bearing heritage divine
In stannic pearls, the light pours over the rock-grey coats of the proud
Your radiance crystalline, heralds the ancient words
Resounding high and clear from the Otherworld
To declare the rise of the night-born
In this night we dance, glory to the nameless one
Atir aissom atir imon

Caressed by your velvet touch, as we dance through the night
One last silver kiss, as the ancient song falls silent

One last silver kiss before the last string decays
