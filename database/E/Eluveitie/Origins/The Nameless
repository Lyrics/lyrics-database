Holy Father in Darkness, hallowed be Thy name
Thy kingdom came, the rise of Thy reign
The bloom of the silvern night
Hail King of Antumnos
Holy Father in Darkness, Thy will was done
When the gates of Antumnos were opened wide

From Thy bosom arose in glory
The children of the Otherworld

You are the nameless, you’re the primordial one
Who was, who is, and is to come
Senisteros, you are my genesis

A rose e’er blooming from noble stem
Hath sprung the tribes of the night born
Holy Father in Darkness, bright sun of the night
Thine is the power and the glory, forevermore

Holy Father in Darkness, blessed be Thy name
Thy kingdom came, the rise of Thy reign
From Thy bosom arose in glory
The children of the Otherworld

You are the nameless, you’re the primordial one
Who was, who is, and is to come
Senisteros, you are my genesis

He who has ears, let him hear
