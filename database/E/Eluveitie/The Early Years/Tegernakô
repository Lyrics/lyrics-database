A folk of cheeriness and strength
content with the life they lived
So-called barbarians yet with eyes cleared
for what they truly need and what damn not

free and plain

Barbarians, farmers and savages
counted as ignorant and uncivil
But told to bow before the emperors throne
they were at least not venal

True and plain freedom - of this natures clan
True and plain pride - of this Celtic clan
True and plain dignity - Tegernako!

Not for riches, not for sway
not for economic benefits
met they the emperors requirements
for freedom can’t be bought
