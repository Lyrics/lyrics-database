As the shore is not sea nor land,
like the time between the times
where the dawning is not day nor night
you are between the worlds…

Endless circle, bearing my footprints
With fast-sure-hand you guide my steps

And so I trod on your endless paths
And travel on throughout eternity
In these labyrinths of life
Not to know what the next step will bring

And so I trust in your endless paths
And travel on throughout eternity
In these labyrinths of life,
Not to know what the next step will bring

You keep the worlds aligned
You bond b’tween soul and flesh
You draw to the heart of hearts
With wisdom beyond fate

Endless knot, bearing my footprints
With fast-sure-hand you guide my steps
