Curtain’s up for this lurid age
Clear the ring for oppression and greed
Welcome to this wasteland
Of blight and havoc
Once known as my home

Deleting fulfilled
Erasing procedure done
Cleansing complete
It’s done, my friend
It’s over and done

There was nothing left
But the smell of salassian blood
Nil and nothing left
But the braying void in our homes

I never forgot the eyes of the kids
Wrested from their moms
To be sold into slavery
I still can hear
The cries of the raped
And the bellow of the flames
The hymn of absurd death

Heed the chronicles
Of lucrative genocide
The annals of effaced tribes
Pages written in blood

Ave Caesar Augustus
It’s done, my friend
It’s over and done
