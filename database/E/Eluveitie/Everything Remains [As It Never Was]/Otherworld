Where ere thou hast been,
Here or in yon world manifest,
Canst thou tell
What is, or what was or what is to come?
No thing shall last
And there are things
That shall never change.
History is written in blood,
Yet are battles really lost
On the battlefields?
Canst thou tell me whence thou comest
And where thou goest
And what is, or what was, or what is to come?
For everything remains as it never was.
