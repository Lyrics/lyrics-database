Scorched earth we left
A barren land of ash
Our fatherland laid waste
Be the void our fucking monument

At a leaden dawn
At this ominous morn

Pila loomed on the horizon
Talons of the wolverine
Exanimate legions formed
At the very gates of Avaricum
Believed invulnerable
This calling wall
But straight out of nowhere
Before our eyes this godsdawn bane arose

Thus Avaricum burns
Under a dead sky
Avaricum drowns
In blood and demise

Siege towers emerged
Protruding from the ground
Standing out against the threatening sky
As if to mock all valiantness
Face to face with an eye-leveled enemy
Serried roman ranks
Embattled upon our hold

Cut off and trapped inside
As the carnage was at hand
As the creak of the winches extolled our doom
The slaughter befell Avaricum
Dead suffused the oppidum
Left to pillage, sack and rape
Avaricum the brave became Avaricum the grave
