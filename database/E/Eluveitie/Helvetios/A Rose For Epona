Do you feel the thorns?
Do you see the tears?
Do you see the blood shed in this fell war?
Have you forsaken us?
Have you forgotten our faithful men calling your name?

While I stand before you
While we perish
While I lay down a crimson rose
While holding hands
Are forced apart
While hopes bog like condemned men

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand’s turning old and weak
I’m giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

In your nemeton
These grey stone walls
Are cold and silent
As the fallen
Mother gone deaf
Mistress of shattered hopes
And forever broken dreams

Were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand’s turning old and weak
I’m giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere

Epo, epo why hast thou forsaken me?
Together we go unsung
Into thy hand I commend my spirit
Together we go down with our people

Were you there? were you there?

The sky is falling on me
As your hand’s turning old and weak
I’m giving myself up to thee
A futile sacrifice gone sere
Falling on me…
