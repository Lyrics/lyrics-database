It has been decided. We’ll set forth on this journey.

We packed the wagons
Everything arranged, there is no turning back
The time has come
All too soon
A stab all through my heart

The afterglow
Glimmered on the roof of our homestead
We bode the nightfall at hand
Belive set out into the dark

In this night the fires roared
As fields were set ablaze
It rained ash from the sky
In a flaring hiss at night

Forward the land we knew
Off to far and distant shores
A safe haven
Off to these Santonian Shores

At the set of the sun
As mist billowed over the land
We got under way
Wandering, towards our hopes
I bode awhile and looked back
Gaued into the sea of flames
laying waste what we called home
I won’t see this place again

A cortege as far as the eye can see
A vast migrant parade
The glow of a distant dream
the awakening came nigh
under a starlit sky
Dreams within our hearts
Step by step we marched
Away into the night
