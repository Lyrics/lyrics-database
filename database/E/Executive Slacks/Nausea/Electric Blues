I see a man without a dream
I see a man lost in between
He’s never had a chance to lose
He’s lost inside the electric blues

’Cause… Electric Blues come down
Down without a sound

I see a man who isn’t right
Open eyes all through the night
He moves around from town to town
His heart, it beats without a sound

’Cause… Electric Blues come down
Down without a sound

I see a man without a dream
I see a man lost in between
He’s never had a chance to lose
He’s lost inside the electric blues

’Cause… Electric Blues come down
Down without a sound

Electric Blues come down
Electric Blues come down

Down, down, down, down, down
Electric Blues come down

Come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down
