Kitty with the cream
Out in the yard
I know it, I see it
I feel you out there
You’d better not run ’cause there’s flowers everywhere

Flame head with the kids
Out in the yard
I know it, I see it
I feel you out there
You’d better not run ’cause there’s children everywhere

Kitty with the cream
Out in the yard
I know it, I see it
I feel you out there
You’d better not run ’cause there’s flowers everywhere
