We wanna go out
Go outside
We’re stuck in here
Stuck in a room

We wanna go out
Go outside
We’re stuck in here
Stuck in a room

Look at the sun
It’s coming down
We wanna go out
Out to the park

Look at the sun
It’s coming down
We wanna go out
Out to the park

We wanna go out
Go outside
We’re stuck in here
Stuck in a room

We wanna go out
Go outside
We’re stuck in here
Stuck in a room

Look at the sun
It’s coming down
We wanna go out
Out to the park

Look at the sun
It’s coming down
We wanna go out
Out to the park
