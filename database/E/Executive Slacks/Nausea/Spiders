The spider’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down
The painting’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down

You put your mark up there
You put it on the wall
I put some spackle down
The wall is coming down

You put your mark up there
You put it on the wall
I put some spackle down
The wall is coming down

The spider’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down
The painting’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down

The spider’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down
The painting’s on the wall
I know it’s coming down

You put your mark up there
You put it on the wall
I put some spackle down
The wall is coming down
