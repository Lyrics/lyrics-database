The Situations are irrelevant now.
She loves the way that I tease,
I love the way that she breathes

I touched her ooohh,
She touched my ahhh,
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who hate to love because they're just like me.

A certain girl, she took my hand and ran it up her thigh.
She licked her lips and pulled my hair
I fall in love for a night.

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion.
Leave me, go where you belong,
Higher heels and lipstick napkins,
Dying is your latest fashion.

The frustration, it's a regular thing
I hate the ones who love to hate because they're just like me.
A certain girl she took her hand and put in my lap
It's way too full she said "once you have me you'll always come back."

She can't behave and I'm just a slave,
Don't worry I'll be gone when the morning comes.

Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins,
Dying is your latest fashion.

I know you love to resist
And all it takes is a kiss
And you just love to hate me.

You know you love all the lies
So don't act surprised
That I just love to hate you.

I kissed your lips, you pulled my hair
It was the craziest thing.
I love the girls who love to hate.
(Breathing)

(Whoa!) Darling, what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me, go where you belong
higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your latest fashion

Darling,(leave me) what is going on?
Honestly that never happened
Lying is your favorite passion
Leave me (darling), go where you belong
Higher heels and lipstick napkins
Dying is your favorite passion
