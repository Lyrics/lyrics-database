Now, who elected you judge and jury
In the body of a beautiful girl?
And I suspect heavy gerrymandering
At the singles bar

And now, I’m a man with conversation skills
And I’m a man with hundred dollar bills
And just a look in my direction one time
Is all it’s going take now, come on man

Heee-hee-hee, yee-hee

And I know you think I’m just another sucker perpetrator
Living in the 213
And I don’t care what you say about any of that, no
It don’t matter to me, yeah

I see you driving around in your fancy car
You’re a superstar living in the 310
And I will freak you like you’ve never been freaked before, now
And I’m ready to go, yeah

Heee-hee-hee, yee-hee

(Come on)

3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off in your ship
3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off in your ship
3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off, ready to go off now

Haa-haa, haaa
Haa-haa, haa-aah-aah

Hey girl
When I’m fucking you
It’s like nothing else matters
You make me wanna reach down
Between my legs
And ease the seat back

Hee-hee-hee, hee-ee

3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off in your ship
3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off in your ship
3, 2, 1 — I’m the bomb
And I’m ready to go off, ready to go off now

Haa-haa, haaa
Haa-haa, haaa-aah
Haa-haa, haaa
Haa-haa, haaa
