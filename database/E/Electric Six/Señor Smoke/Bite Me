Are you ready for my sucky-sucky?
Are you ready to be set free?
Are you ready to syphon gasoline?
Are you ready for the number 3?

Are you ready for big-big savings?
Are you ready for the master’s hand?
Are you ready for the bloody-bloody?
Are you ready to, sing, are you ready to bite me?

Delight me
Our plane hasn’t leave for you to excite me
Your body is something I might not survive
So bite me, bite me!

Are you ready for the Devil’s daughter?
Are you ready for the Soylent Green?
Are you ready for unholy water?
Are you ready for my fucking machine?

Are you ready for American strike-force?
Are you ready for the mystery meat?
Are you ready for my crazy-crazy?
Are you ready to, sing, are you ready to bite me?

Delight me
Our plane hasn’t leave for you to excite me
Your body is something I might not survive
So bite me, bite me!

Go!

People heading for a dirty future
People lining up a party ball
People sucking on their computer
And other counters pay for it all

We were so in love
We were so in love
We were so in love
We were so in love
We were so in love
We were so in love
We were so in love
And we were ready to bite me!

Delight me
Our plane hasn’t leave for you to excite me
Your body is something I might not survive
So bite me, bite me!

Come on and bite me!

Delight me
Our plane hasn’t leave for you to excite me
Your body is something I might not survive
So bite me
