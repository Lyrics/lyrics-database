Un, deux, trois, quatre

You were walking down the street
You were just across the street
So I had to cross the street
To get to your side of the street

It’s torture
It’s torture
I need you so bad, girl
It’s torturing me

You scorcher
You scorcher
Fried egg on your face, girl
You’re scorching me, yea

Be my, be my, be my Dark Angel
Be my, be my Capri Sun
Be my, be my
Vicious and evil one

The question, the answer
The disco, the dancer
The places you’ll never go
The places you’ll never know

It hurts me
It hurts me
Believe me, it hurts me, it’s hurting me, ye

The questions, the queries
The rhetoric, the theories
It hurts me, yea

Be my, be my, be my Dark Angel
Be my, be my Blue Sunshine
Be my, be my
American Concubine

I am havin’ a whirl
Of Canadian go-go girls
Japanese karate girls
Black girls, White girls, China girls
Australian Asian, European, Pan-American girls
When bad girls start wrestling
Everybode wants to be the next referee (including me)

The record is skipping
The dance is disturbing
The Jacksons are reuniting — They’re going on tour
Then I can’t take it anymore!

Be my, be my, be my Dark Angel
Be my, be my Blue Bunshine
Be my, be my
Mrs. Dick Valentine
