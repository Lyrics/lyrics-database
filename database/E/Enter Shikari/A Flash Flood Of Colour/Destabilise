Today for the very first time
We started planning out the ultimate crime
Locking together to destroy this cold stasis
Rory C, what’s your thesis?
I don’t fucking believe it!
Institutions are established and invested
Pause to ask "are they tried and tested?"
No; just force-fed and digested.
It’s about time we damn contested.

You can’t stain us
You can’t contain us
You cant destabilise, divide or label us
You can’t stain us
You can’t contain us
You cant destabilise
Destabilise

Now they’re cracking under pressure from our force
’cause we know
’cause we don’t belong here
And we’re rising through the stubborn assault course
But we’re stuck in the middle
’cause we don’t belong here
We don’t belong here
We don’t belong here
Our minds our dormant and static
Don’t ever respect conventional thought without reason
We need to fucking erupt!

Corrupted fucking tyrants, instigating violence,
This sporadic discordance will find maximum assurance

Now they’re cracking under pressure from our force
’cause we know
’cause we don’t belong here
So we’re rising through the stubborn assault course
But we’re stuck in the middle

’cause we don’t belong here
Now they’re cracking under pressure from our force
’cause we don’t belong here
So we’re rising through the stubborn assault course

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you

No one owns the oceans!
No one owns the mountains!
No one owns us!
No one owns us!
We’ve all inherited this world!
We need to fucking erupt!
’cause this earth is ours!
We need to fucking erupt!
Yeah!

Now they’re cracking under pressure from our force
’cause we know
’cause we don’t belong here
So we’re rising through the stubborn assault course
’cause we don’t belong here
Now they’re cracking under pressure from our force
’cause we don’t belong here
So we’re rising through the stubborn assault course
’cause we don’t belong here

This is the calm before the storm
One last siege to break the norm
So I can lie here on the floor
Beside you.
