It’s your future

Oh!
This is gonna change everything!
This is gonna change everything!
This is gonna change everything!

System Meltdown, meltdown, meltdown!

Stand up!
How are we gonna get through this life, get through this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)
Stand up!
How are we gonna get out this life, get out this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)
Stand up!
How are we gonna get through this life, get through this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)

Countries are just lines
Drawn in the sand with a stick!

Stand up!

Inside this sick foundation
We’ve had the realization
Inside this sick foundation
We’ve had the revelation

Fuck all borders
And fuck all boundaries
Fuck all flags
And fuck nationalities

You’ve gotta give us a chance before we reach a
System meltdown, meltdown, meltdown

Stand up!
How are we gonna get through this life, get through this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)
Stand up!
How are we gonna get out this life, get out this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)
Stand up!
How are we gonna get through this life, get through this life
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)

Countries are just lines
Drawn in the sand with a stick!

Inside this sick foundation
We’ve had the realization
Inside this sick foundation
We’ve had the revelation

We begin to let them smile again
Start to walk that extra mile again
’Cause I haven’t got much!
We are one

(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)

Stand up!
(It’s not too late, it’s not too late)

Things begin to vanish when we realize that
Countries are just lines
Drawn in the sand with a stick!
