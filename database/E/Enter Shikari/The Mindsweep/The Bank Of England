I refuse to notice the wind or the rain
To teach me of nature would be done in vain
I ignore all:
I just contain

Predicated on a great disconnect
I don’t react and I do not reflect
I ignore all:
I just retain

The invisible hand no longer guides, it chokes;
The invisible hand no longer guides

They blew up the bank of England
The paper burnt for days
They blew up the bank of England
Oh

In the end we all employ sabotage
No room for ethics now, greed is in charge
I ignore all:
I just constrain

How many barrels are left in the field?
I only care for the coins that you yield
I ignore all:
I just obtain
