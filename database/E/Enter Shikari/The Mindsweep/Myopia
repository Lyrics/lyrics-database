Drip, drip, drop, bit by bit
It’s the dulcet sound of the glacial melt
Accompanied by the Beluga
Singing about the hand they’ve been dealt
The Emperor and the Arctic Fox listen intently

"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune
"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life
Yes, they’re lost in myopia. Yes, they’re lost in myopia"

Surrounded by ostriches with mouths full of sand
Their teeth grind the grains, but their faces don’t contort
Perplexed, I am unable to breathe in their skin
We are all vertebrates but where is that backbone now?

"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune
"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune

As the Emperor watches his numbers plummet they hear him scream:
"They’re living in denial of science
They’re happy to defile silence
Yeah, they’re living in denial of science
They’re happy to defile silence"

"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune

Deprived is the polar bear, grasping at straws;
To safeguard dividends they depend on disbelief
Perplexed, I am unable to breathe in their skin
We are all vertebrates but where is that backbone now?

"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune
"I’m beginning to get glimpses of what is called real life"
He says, meaning misfortune

As the Emperor watches his numbers plummet they hear him scream:
"They’re living in denial of science
They’re happy to defile silence
Yeah, they’re living in denial of science
They’re happy to defile silence"
