I can be the way you wanted me to be
But you're leaving and I miss you, you know
You could be the mountains
I could be the sea
Because I've been tearing us apart
But I miss you, you know

Talking in your sleep when you're all alone
Waiting on me to come back home
I can see you walking far away
I don't know how
So I'll just wait
I'll just wait
Here now

I was half a man
You needed one that's whole
But I was giving everything because I miss you, you know

Talking in your sleep when you're all alone
Waiting on me to come back home
I can see you walking far away
I don't know why
So I'll just wait
I'll just wait

Are you happy?
Are you happier?
Yea you know me all the years I've been around
And the fears that you found out
But I'm still waiting
You believe in faith and
I believe in truth
But I'm praying
Because I miss you
I do

Talking in your sleep when you're all alone
Waiting on me to come back home
I can see you walking far away
I don't know why
So I'll just wait
