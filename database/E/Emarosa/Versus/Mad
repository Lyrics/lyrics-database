So won't you save the part of me that's broke again
And don't be hateful if I'm unfaithful
So wait
Something tells me I'm a fake
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me
And I've been in shambles before
But I can't feel anymore
So wait
Something tells me I might break
Now lie to me or run away and hide from me
How you feel

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name

Been awake for so long
And you say I'll be my father's son
Now I can never tell a lie to you
Because I've seen what they can do
Being in love is so lost
And I will never look again
I hope
But I know

There's a part of me hoping you can find a better part of me

Even if he tastes the same
Even if you say my name
