We can remember swimmin’ in December
Headin’ for the city lights in 1975
We’re sharin’ each other, nearer than farther
The scent of a lemon drips from your eyes

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

We lived an adventure, love in the summer
Followed the sun ’til night, reminiscing other times of life
For each every other the feeling was stronger
The shock hit eleven, we got lost in your eyes

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

Can you remember and humanize?
It was still where we’d energize
Lie in the sand and visualize like it’s
’75 again

We are the people that rule the world
A force running in every boy and girl
All rejoicing in the world
Take me now, we can try

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us

I know everything about you
You know everything about me
We know everything about us

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?

I can’t do well when I think you’re gonna leave me
But I know I try
Are you gonna leave me now?
Can’t you be believin’ now?
