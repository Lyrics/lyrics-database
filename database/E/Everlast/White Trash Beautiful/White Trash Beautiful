White trash beautiful
Trailer park queen

She slings hash at the diner from 11 to 5
She married a boy from school
Thought he was oh, so cool
But all he can do for money is drive

Out late haulin’ freight on Interstate 5
Prayin’ he’ll see home before his baby arrive

White trash beautiful
There’s something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you could’ve found a better guy
I’ll love you ’til the day I die
I swear to God, it’s true

I’m comin’ home to you
I’m comin’ home to you, girl

He lights a cigarette, his eyes half-open
He won’t be home tonight, but she keeps hopin’
Drinkin’ himself to sleep
Is his only way of copin’
She waits for him every night
She leaves the front door open

It’s 4am, I’m doin’ 95
Tryin’ to stay awake and make it home alive

White trash beautiful
There’s something you should know
My heart belongs to you
I know you could’ve found a better guy
I’ll love you ’til the day I die
I swear to God, it’s true

I’m comin’ home to you
I’m comin’ home to you, girl

Her lips stay painted red, her name tag’s crooked
Her heart’s been gone awhile with the truck-driving man that took it
He keeps her photograph on his rear-view mirror
She prays for him every night, she hopes that he can hear her

White trash beautiful
There’s something you should know
My heart belongs to you, girl
I know you could’ve found yourself a better guy
I’ll love you ’til the day I die
I swear to God, it’s true

I’m comin’ home to you
I’m comin’ home to you, girl

I’m comin’ home to you
I’m comin’ home to you, girl

I’m comin’ home to you
