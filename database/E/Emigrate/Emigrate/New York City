I’m lost in a world of lights
Mesmerize my nights
The sky scrapes on buildings sights
I’m feelin’ so alive

Whatever’s clever
Whatever’s clever will have to wait…

Thinking on the world at large
The city’s got it all
Culture clash and sidewalk trash
Don’t look down you might fall

And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City, it’s the place to be

I’m gonna win, I’m gonna lose
I’m gonna chase it ’til the end
And if you’re walking in my shoes
You’re gonna make it or pretend

Whatever’s clever
Whatever’s clever will have to wait…

And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City, it’s the place to be

(And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City, it’s the place to be)

And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City, it’s the place to be

And now we just feel like energy
New York City will never sleep
And now we just feel like synergy
New York City, it’s the place to be

New York City!

And now we just feel like energy
Oh, yeah
New York City will never sleep
It’s the place to be
And now we just feel like synergy
Oh, yeah
New York City, it’s the place to be

Yeah

It’s the place to be
It’s the place to be
