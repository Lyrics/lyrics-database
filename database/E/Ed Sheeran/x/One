Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
’Cause you’re waiting for me
And I know, you’re gonna be away a while
But I’ve got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I’m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I’ll never leave again
’Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you’ll always be a friend
’Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We’ll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
But just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I’m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I’ll never leave again
’Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you’ll always be a friend
’Cause you are the only one

I’m stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong

All my senses come to life
While I’m stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I’ll never leave again
’Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you’ll always be a friend
’Cause you are the only one
