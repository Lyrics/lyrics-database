You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You’ve got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I’m so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife Sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I’m so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me
Lumière, darling
Lumière over me

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need

I’m so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You looked so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you back
