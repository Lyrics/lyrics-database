(You no good dirty son of a bitch, sneaking peeks at my pussy)

(You no good dirty son of a bitch)

[Move! Get outta the way!]

I am your love
I am your hate
All this and more
For me and my whore

Make me lie down
And beg like a dog
Whip my behind
If I should do wrong

(Oh, you bastard)
(O-oh, you bastard)

Follow me ’round
Until I get lost
Then pull back my chain
And show me who’s boss

Don’t be afraid
No need for this shit
You’re my private nurse
This won’t hurt a bit

Pull back my skin
And stick me with pins
Move closer to me

(Oh, you bastard)
(You dirty bastard, did you think I’ll ever let you touch me there?)

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won’t shout

Twist my insides
Blind both my eyes
Pull my guts out
I swear I won’t shout!

I swear I won’t shout
I won’t shout!

What a trip!

(Oh, you bastard)
(You dirty bastard, did you think I’ll ever let you touch me there?)

(You’ve been sneaking peeks at my pussy, I won’t see your cock any fucking second, you bitch)
(What is this, ah? What is this with your little thing?)
(I’ll show you the first class hots for being an inobedient bitch)

(Oh, you bastard)
(Oh, you bastard)
(Oh, you bastard)

(You no good dirty son of a bitch!)

[Move! Get outta the way!]

(You think you know that man)
(You really don’t)
