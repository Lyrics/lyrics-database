(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)

(That is quite impossible)

Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap
(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)
Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap [the trap]
(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)
(I’m trapped)

Cold wind in your hair
Sitting on a true green chair
But your thought will run around again
Feel like unreal

Try more a hand can hold
The taste of self-confidence so far
But you don’t realize
You remove to a wrap

To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap

I see you crash down
In a sea of decline
I see you crash down
Toxicated you are mine

Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap [the trap]
Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

[the trap]

Try more a hand can hold
The taste of self-confidence so far
But you don’t realize
You remove to a wrap

[the trap]

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap
To the wrap - the trap

(My life is my own)
(That is quite impossible)

(That is quite impossible)
(My life is my own)

Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap
(I’m trapped, I’m trapped, I’m trapped)
Enclosed by a storm you can’t return from the wrap
(I’m trapped, I’m trapped, I’m trapped)

[the trap]
