Looks like the summertime’s been forcing all the freaks onto the streets again
Everyplace I look — a crazy face, just stopping short of looking real insane
The madman on the corners shouting “truth before dishonour”, no one knows his name
As a thousand border liners passing by, how hard they tryin’ just to miss his gaze
Why don’t you slip away?

This could be heaven, but the heat makes even angels start to feel the strain
Now no one seems too bothered, no one looks at one another, that’s the state of play
As the derelict Messiahs preach to hoardings under flyers about some judgement day
And the temperature keeps rising till the tension fills the sky and only dreams escape
Why can’t we slip away?

(Why can’t we slip away, why can’t we slip away?)
(Why can’t we slip away, why can’t we slip away?)
(Why can’t we slip away, why can’t we slip away?)
(Why can’t we slip away, why can’t we slip away?)

(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)
(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)

The sunlight burns the eyes, so now nobody sees the signs, too busy hunting shade
The pretty girls all shine and all the boys just stand in line like there’s no finer place
Too hard to sleep, looks like the dreams will have to keep until some other day
Too hard to breathe, this city is suffocating me, if that’s the price I’ll pay
Guess I’ll just slip away

(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)
(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)

(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)
(Slip away, slip away, slip away, why don’t you slip away?)
