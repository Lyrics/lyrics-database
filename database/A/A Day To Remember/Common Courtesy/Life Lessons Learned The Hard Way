Life lessons learned the hard way.

Four people waited in a random white unmarked van.
Parked outside your hotel high rise garage.
To use a tire iron to break the bones inside your legs.
Too bad you never came outside, that's all right,
'Cause in the end you'll get wrecked.
Yeah, in the end, you'll get wrecked.

I heard a little girl killed herself today, that blood's on your hands.
It's on your hands, when everyone knows your face, nothing's safe.
You'll live your life as a fucking target.

You've earned my disgust.
You've earned my disgust.
