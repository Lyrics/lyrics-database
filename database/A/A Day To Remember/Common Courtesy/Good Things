Hello, you don't seem like yourself
At least from what I knew, you're somebody else
Oh no, it's so much harder to take
It took me four years to realize you're a fake
But I won't lie, I'd forfeit all the rest of my time to patch things up
Just to take back what you stole of mine

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You know, I grew so tired of the games you consistently played, where I took all the blame
It's true, you're just unhappy with you
You drink every night, so you can't think things through
And I, I tried, to give you peace of mind
One day you'll wake up, and realize what's passed you by

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

Good things don't end, they end badly
You got a lot of nerve, and I'm not catching up
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
You don't care, I knew you never cared

You say it's over? I say, what's the rush?
No matter what, it's never enough
I don't care, you know that I ain't scared.

Good things don't end, they end badly
We've been here before and I'm all outta luck
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out
(You had a good thing, you lost a good thing)

Good things don't end, they end badly
You got a lot of nerve, and I'm not catching up
It's not workin' out, we're just not workin' out

Good things don't end, they end badly
