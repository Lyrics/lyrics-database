Fuck ya!

Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream
Well it still is, and I never wanna wake
Standing in my backyard at our old practice space
Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me
Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me
We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now
We never questioned it, was more like when and how

That was then, this is now
Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't

This is our corner of the world
Where we can come to be ignored
This is our point where we return
This is where I came from
This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from

Ya!

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us
Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough
Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around

Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again
Oh oh oh, this is where I came from

This is what made us who we became
Where they know me, not just my name
There's not another place the same
This is where I came from
This is where I came from
