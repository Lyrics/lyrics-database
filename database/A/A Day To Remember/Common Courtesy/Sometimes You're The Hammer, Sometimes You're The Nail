You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
Go get carried away

Go!

And the fears sets in, in an instant
Too much of myself gets exposed
This is where I go at my weakest
When I don’t have to be scared to tell the truth

Tend to do my best when everything goes wrong
That’s why sad songs make me happy, ’cause I don’t have to feel alone

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
No, you’ve got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

It’s never what you’ve done, it’s what you’ve done lately
Who cares what you’re saying, if no one’s listening
You don’t have to like me, but you’re gonna respect me
I that came from nothing, leave hope in my wake

I got no regrets, but have my days with doubt
To those left in sadness I’ll be the one to lead you out

You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Take it away from me
You can’t wait, wait, wait, wait, wait till I’m stumbling
No, you’ve got me wrong
Oh the nights are long with no one else around
You wanna take, take, take, take, take it away from me
Go get carried away

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don’t make me who I am

I reserve my right to feel uncomfortable reserve, my right to be afraid
I make mistakes and I am humbled every step of the way
I want to be a better person, I wanna know the master plan
Cast your stones, cast your judgement, you don’t make me who I am

God help those who help themselves, and forget about everyone else
You lost your nerve, you missed the point
God help those with open hands, may they never feel burden again
Yeah I’ll stand up for those who can’t
I’ll close the distance
