It’s never too late to be early or to try
and maintain some scrap of integrity and certainty I guess.
But I won’t apologize and 1977 was a long time ago.

(My fingers… are blistered… and bleeding…)
I dont care how things were I won’t apologize.
Fuck you.

The Alamo has been penetrated
and there is little hope for the white man
so hop on your rainbow and ride it into oblivion.

(My fingers… are blistered… and bleeding…)
For all I care you can be early or late, whatever.
(There’s no longer… discomfort… that you brought…)
