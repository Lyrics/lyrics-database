We dedicate this song to all hackers, DJ’s
Activists
All riot girls

Modern liars, love machines
They get inspired and steal your dreams
The price of victory was never higher

If you want it all
Then you can have it
If you want it all
Just take it

Algorithms, algorithms
Have you found your new religion?
Data hell or road to freedom
Tweak technology

Some say that computers are destroying our humanity
But we say that computers are controlled by men
And they can be used to help humanity
