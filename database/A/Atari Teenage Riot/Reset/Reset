We live in a decade
Where violence breeds more violence
Destructive forces are at work
It’s time to ask yourself the question:
Do you still own your future?
And do you sometimes just want to start all over again?
Reset

Atari Teenage Riot is ready to go

When they try to drag you down
And you are on your own
Hook it up and press "Reset"
Hook it up and press "Reset"
Reset, Reset

Don’t give up the world
To those you despise
Cause when we’re finished
Discouragement will be gone
Your mind is a weapon
So don’t waste more time

Never fit in
Stay under radar
Mix with the crowd
Be a shadow
R E S E T
Format everything
Know your enemy
Restart everything
