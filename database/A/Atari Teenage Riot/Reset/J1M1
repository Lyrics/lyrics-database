They keep an eye on every move
Organized puppets fools, fiction on a screen
Lost in the freedom we found
Greed and control, cameras on everything

The watching eye, government spies
Paid to tell lies and in the end who wins
Pow so it all falls down
It all falls down

Hell on earth
Man created the devil and the devil created the excuse
To justify the killings
That we don’t see on the news
And I wonder: Will history repeat itself?
When they’re numbering you

They’ll try to hurt you
Through the good they see in you
Don’t let it break you
Don’t let it break you

They’ll try to punish you
For the good they see in you
They know they need it
Don’t let it break you

Knock, knock mocking bird stop bang
And another one’s down
Fuck your 2 seconds and we lay down flat
Face to the ground, face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we’d be face to the ground
Face to the ground, face to the ground
If they had their way we’d be face to the ground
So we can’t back down

The world is far from being safer
Cypher spend you life in danger
Prosecute me
How can a man exist in this and still be free?
Third eye is eternally on standby
They’re numbering you
