News, drug abuse to the future and the hypocrites cry:
Who dies next?
And I tell you a story from the underground nothing funny about
Get down to get hyped!
Kill me and no one’s gonna miss me…
Feel the heat of the highway! To the car to the key of reality!
More and more and more and there’s no way back! Bored I am .. Yes I Can!
You may not count in the New World Order!
And now it’s time to die
cause I can see the sun the end is near I’m feeling high ...
How fast can I run?
Risin’, risin’ to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
1, 2, 3 and 4 - Got the joker shoot the score!

Speed! Just wouldn’t believe it!

Tomorrow, tomorrow, always tomorrow
There is no future in the western dreamin’!
We feel it, we must beat ’em !
It’s too late to create a new world!
Alternative living it must be given a chance!
Water the problem’s solution! No solution if you can’t use it!

And then I heard the siren of the police!
My blood went up to 90 degrees!
You can’t see white cats in the snow
Oh human being, how low can you go?
Risin’, risin’ to the top
the pills are ready to be dropped
1, 2, 3 and 4
Got the joker shoot the score!

Speed! Just wouldn’t believe it!
