I can’t see myself holding on for much longer,
I can’t see myself holding on for much longer,
It’s tearing me apart
I feel so out of place from the rest of you
All I needed was something
And that something was you
But you’re so far away now,
Can you hear me screaming?
Can you hear me screaming?
Can you hear me screaming?
Can you hear me screaming?
