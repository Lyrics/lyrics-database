Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
The wind was taking us in the wrong direction
It’s about time we showed some disaffection

Carry the weight of thousands of years
Turn the page, let’s make it all disappear
We’ve had enough of inhibited progression
Held back by cloak-and-dagger oppression

We’re insulting our own intelligence
I won’t listen without any evidence
I’ll live my life in the name of no one
Bow your head, palm to palm
Worship here in this cerebral cathedral

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals
These chains that we’ve been living in…;
How easily we’ve been giving in!

Now shed this skin and let change begin…;

As day breaks, the sunlight heals
As day breaks, the light reveals

Navigation in nautical twilight
Separation from what we know is right
It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking

It feels to me like this boat is sinking
Weighed down by rational thinking
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn, relieve the friction

Blue hours quicken the pulse
Upon the upper edge, reality dawns!

Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn, relieve the friction
Light begins to pierce the distance
Solar dawn, relieve the friction!
