Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven’t sunk this low

Sunk this low

(Rotten to the core)
So who’s left to count the cost?
Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost
Now we’re gone, left without a trace
But we took something they cannot replace

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We’ve been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

You chew up peace and spit it out as war
You’ve been feeding the wolf that’s waiting at the door
You are rotten to the core
We found your fingerprints all over the trigger
If you’re looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror

You knew all along that the cancer would spread
So don’t be surprised to find a price on your head
Sorry son but we destroyed your home
We murdered your family, now you’re on your own
Collateral damage, face down in the sand
Watch the dominoes fall, it’s all just part of the plan

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We’ve been down this path before
Cold blooded retribution
So fuck your revolution

A match made in heaven paved the road to hell
We’ve been down this path before
And every execution
The price of your collusion

Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow?
All the anchors in the ocean haven’t sunk this low

Sunk this low

You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
You are rotten to the core
