This is a wake up call, no rise without the fall
Facing the great divide, you can run but you can’t hide

You can run but you can’t hide

I met the devil and God and couldn’t tell them apart
I thought I found the end but it was only the start

I’ve heard it all before
Aren’t you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
(Just let go) Gravity, hold on to me

So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck that we don’t last forever (It’s now or never)
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere
Because it’s gone and it’s never coming back

But make no mistake
It’s just a matter of time before the wave breaks
So stand your ground, the earth will shake
So twist the knife ’cause I am finally awake

So come and wash us away
Just thank fuck we don’t last forever (It’s now or never)
Is this the catalyst?
Just let me burn the bridge that leads me nowhere
Because it’s gone and it’s never coming back

I’ve heard it all before
Aren’t you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
(Just let go) Well, what are you waiting for?
Aren’t you tired of all of the violence inside of you?
(It’s all you know) Gravity, hold on to me

So stand your ground, the earth will shake
So twist the knife ’cause I am finally awake
