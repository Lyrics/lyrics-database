They want all for one and none for all
I want to be there to witness the downfall

They’ll only sell us out when our backs are turned
And we’ll keep paying the price until our lesson is learnt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Every snake has its price
If the money’s on the table they don’t think twice
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin

We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see
What’s it going to take to get us to stand up?
’Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don’t give a fuck
About what matters to us

Another faceless figure, an empty silhouette
They’ll line their pockets and leave us six feet deep in debt
So cast your votes, watch them shed their skin
Always out for blood, praying on the weak
We can count on them to paint the future bleak
But still we’re standing by whilst they bleed us dry

We are paralysed
But there are none so blind as those who will not see
What’s it going to take to get us to stand up?
’Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don’t give a fuck
About what matters to us

So enough is enough
What’s it going to take to get us to stand up?
’Cause you can see it in their eyes, they don’t give a fuck

"Right" and wrong, it’s all the same to me
Thick as thieves as far as I can see
They are leeches all (They are leeches all)

"Right" and wrong, it’s all the same to me (Same to me)
Thick as thieves as far as I can see, I can see
They are leeches all (They are leeches all)
But we’re still standing by whilst they bleed us dry

They want all for one and none for all
I want to be there to witness the downfall

We are paralysed
They want all for one and none for all
I want to be there to witness the downfall
