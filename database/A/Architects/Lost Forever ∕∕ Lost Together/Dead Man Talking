These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god’s salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

You’ve got to watch your back
You’ve got to swallow fear
Cover your tracks or you might disappear
They found the words to speak unspeakable things
They struck the air from the chests of kings

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god’s salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

If you were caught between the devil and the deep blue sea…
Would you run and hide or stand for what you believe?
Maybe Orwell was right all along…
They think this spells the end, it’s only just begun

These martyrs seek no adoration
No promises of god’s salvation
They kicked the ladder from beneath their feet
They hung the heroes

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won’t forget
Swear that you won’t forget!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won’t forget
Swear that you won’t forget!

Tell the rats to get back in the gutter
We’ll be watching
We’re always watching

You try to stamp them out
You’ll only fan the flames
This is for all the snakes: FUCK YOU!

So hold your forked tongues
You’ve got us spitting nails
I’m gonna say it straight: FUCK YOU!

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
Swear that you won’t forget

If you find your feet, you can eclipse the sun
They think this spells the end, it’s only just begun
