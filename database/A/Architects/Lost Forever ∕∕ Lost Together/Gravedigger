An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you’ve become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some

Bitter and then some

They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow
But we’re still holding on for dear life

You sold us all down the river
I hope you choke on the vows that you failed to deliver
You said you’d change the world but death still flies east
The blind lead the blind, so we bomb for peace

Gravedigger, there’s blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we’ve seen this all before

We’ve given the vampires the keys to the blood bank, oh

They say, "The more things change, the more they stay the same"
Whilst the liars leech, the crooked preach
So lie through your teeth, lie like you mean it
In beggars belief, do you really think that we still fucking believe it?

You fucking parasite

There’s no room in here for an honest man
Only callous and cold hearts

Gravedigger, there’s blood on your hands
You built this empire on salt and sand
Not all is fair in love and war
History repeats, we’ve seen it all before

Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand
Oppressor, you built this empire on salt and sand

An iron fist in a velvet glove
Another vulture posing as a dove
Do you have no shame? Look at what you’ve become
You are the reason we are bitter and then some

Bitter and then some

They sing of saviors, we sing of sorrow
But we’re still holding on for dear life
