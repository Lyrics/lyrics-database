So now that you know it's right
Can you see it from the otherside
Do you see there is no wrong or right
Can you leave them in another tide
There will be no other promise
I can now give to show the other slight
So the ground will make your love light
Hold the sleepers to the morning light

But as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all

So do you lead them to the light
Tie the noose or settle sides
Can you bring them to another life
Can you breathe into a lovers lie
So while we sink into a second sign
Fold the leaves into a dotted line
You will see the limbs of love and pride
Follow suit without a single sigh

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all
It made no sense at all
It made no sense at all

One by one we told ourselves
That they would keep the promises that we made
We made your sons and daughters
They will be nothing like us

I'll never tell you again
So pay your lips to be the seconds I count in over
And breathe life into cold, cold hearts
We will not tell you again,
We will not falter again

So as the doctors came around
No one dared to make a sound
The architecture
Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all
So when the arcs had run aground
And the visitors allowed
We gave conjecture
One by one and it made no sense at all
It made no sense at all
It made no sense at all

I'll never know what leaves your heart
When I will fall, it's to your side
I'll never know what leaves your heart
When I will fall, it's to your side
