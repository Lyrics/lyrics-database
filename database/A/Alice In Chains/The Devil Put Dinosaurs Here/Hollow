Turning in circles, slowing down
Pulling against a closing out
Easy to feed off a weaker thing
Harder to say what I really mean

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

All of your colors turn to grey
Don’t even matter anyway
Bleeding impressions where you were tied
Can’t really say how you lost your mind

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold…

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can’t tell my up from down

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can’t tell my uṗ from down

All of the faces
Life can show
Withered and ugly,
The one you know

Hollow as a mountain
All tunneled and drilled below
Hollow as a mountain
Crowned with a cold, blue sky

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can’t tell my up from down

Silence
So loud
Silence
I can’t tell my uṗ from down
