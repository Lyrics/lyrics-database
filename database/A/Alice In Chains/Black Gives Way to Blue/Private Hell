Give away a love
And then remove another too
Painted words adorn the walls
Echoing untrue

(I feel cold)
A-ha, a-ha, a-ha…

Promises abound
You rarely find it to begin
Maybe I’m afraid
To let you all the way in

(I guess so)
A-ha, a-ha, a-ha…

I excuse myself
I’m used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell

I excuse myself
I’m used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell

Lately I’m beside myself
Pretending, unconcerned
Standing at a corner
Where I threw you on a turn

(I’ll move on)
A-ha, a-ha, a-ha…

Flowers on a cross remain
Mark an ending scene
Damn it all if blood you spill
Turn the grass more green

(Life is short)
A-ha, a-ha, a-ha…

I excuse myself
I’m used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell

I excuse myself
I’m used to my little cell
I amuse myself
In my very own private hell

I amuse myself
In my very own private hell
