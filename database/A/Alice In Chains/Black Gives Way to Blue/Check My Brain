So I found myself in the sun
Oh yeah
A hell of a place to end a run
Oh yeah

California, I’m fine
Somebody check my brain
California’s all right
Somebody check my brain
Check my brain

I walk these streets, I creep and I fall
Oh yeah
When she sang I answered the call
Oh yeah

California, I’m fine
Somebody check my brain
California’s all right
Somebody check my brain

Aaaaah
Tears that filled my bong
Aaaaah
Years expended gone

I hung my guns and put em away
Oh yeah
The trick of the trade, and by the way
Oh yeah

California, I’m fine
Somebody check my brain
California’s all right
Somebody check my brain

Aaaah
Tears that filled my bong
Aaaah
Years expended gone

Aaaah
Tears that filled my bong
Aaaah
Years expended gone

Check my brain
Check my brain
Check my brain
