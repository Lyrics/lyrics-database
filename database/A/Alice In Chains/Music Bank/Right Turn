Inside, always trying to get back inside
But it’s so hard to penetrate pig-thick skin

I’m ’bout as low as I can get
I’d leave but I can’t forget
Still I wonder why, yeah, it ain’t right, mmm it ain’t right, oooh
Ain’t right, mmm it ain’t right, yeah

’Bout as low as she can get
She’ll leave me but she won’t forget
And she wonders why she ain’t right, she ain’t right
Ain’t right, she ain’t right

Now we’re as low as we can get
Can’t leave and can’t forget
We ain’t right, we ain’t right
Not right, we ain’t right

Well it’s hard to believe that somebody tricked you
(ain’t right)
When you can see, you were only high
(ain’t right)
It’s all up to you, so you gamble
(ain’t right)
Flat on your face and into the fire
(ain’t right)

Well it’s hard to believe that somebody tricked you
(ain’t right)
When you can see, you were only high
(ain’t right)
It’s all up to you, so you gamble
(ain’t right)
Flat on your face and into the fire
(ain’t right)
