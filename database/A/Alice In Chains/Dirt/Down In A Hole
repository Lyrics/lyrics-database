Whoo-hoo-hoo…

Bury me softly in this womb
I give this part of me for you
Sand rains down and here I sit
Holding rare flowers in a tomb… (in bloom)

Down in a hole and I don’t know if I can be saved
See my heart I decorate it like a grave
Oh, you don’t understand who they thought I was supposed to be
Look at me now I’m a man who won’t let himself be

Down in a hole,
Feeling so small
Down in a hole,
Losing my soul

I’d like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied

Down in a hole and they’ve put all the stones in their place
I’ve eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste
I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth
I will speak no more of my feelings beneath

Down in a hole,
Feeling so small
Down in a hole,
Losing my soul

I’d like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied

(Bury me softly in this womb)
Oh I want to be inside of you
(I give this part of me for you)
Oh I want to be inside of you

(Sand rains down and here I sit)
(Holding rare flowers) Oh I want to be inside of you
In a tomb… (in bloom)
Oh I want to be inside…

Down in a hole,
Feeling so small
Down in a hole,
Losing my soul

Down in a hole,
Feeling so small
Down in a hole,
Losing my soul

I’d like to fly,
But my wings have been so denied
