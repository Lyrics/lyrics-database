One, a-one time, yeah

Am I too contagious?
Full of sick desire
Am I that I promise?
Burning corpsed pyre

Then some dude
Came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched
And dude ain’t here no more

Suck your woman down

Am I your reflection?
Melting mirror smile
Am I worth the value?
Do my love defile

Then some dude
Came down to touch the Mother
Mother touched
And dude ain’t here no more

Ain’t no day the sun don’t crack
Then to brand some name across my back
But so you care?
Find someone to tell you

Sunshine
Sweet love my labor
Don’t mind
I don’t care no more

Memory, set me free, yeah
I don’t care no more
Mother, please
Come for me

Can you face the question?
Is my soul entire?

Sunshine
Sweet love my labor
Don’t mind
I don’t care no more
