(Oh god, we still have to do this...)

We don’t know what we’re doin’
We don’t know where to start
We have minimal talent
And we’re fumblin’ in the dark

Oh yeah. Oh no. Oh yeah.
Our best member passed away

We don’t know how to write
We don’t know how to sing
We discovered what a guitar was
While going through his things

Oh yeah. Oh no. Oh yeah.
Our best member passed away

Oh our manager says it’s easy, a replacement’s on the way
He says that we’ll have to trust him and give him 90 percent of our pay!
(Is that too much?)

It’s crazy what is happenin’
And we feel we’re in reverse
We’re thinkin’ that it’s all down
To a crazy gypsy curse

Oh yeah. Oh No. Oh yeah.
Our best member passed away

Oh we have no idea how this song’s still going on
We’re thinkin’ it’s because it’s-a legally required to be at least two minutes long

We’re desperate to continue
Please don’t leave us all alone
Because after we must go
Directly to the funeral home

Oh yeah. Oh No. Oh yeah.
Our best member passed away
