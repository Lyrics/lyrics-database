(Out of time…)
Doc, I’m dying, I’m feeling compromised (feeling compromised)
And so dehumanized (and so dehumanized)
I lost my final fight to disease, I feel that this is where it ends
I need that shot to enter my vein
My Brompton Cocktail blend

’Cause I can’t feel my face
I won’t struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I’m not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
In a lie…

I’m tired, induced euphoria (induced euphoria)
To help me move along (help me move along)
I wanna meet my maker in peace, I want to feel alive again
So put that smile back on my face and mix it strong my friend

’Cause I can’t feel my face
I won’t struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I’m not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight ’cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive

I believe my sins have been forgiven
And I believe my choice will save me from this life
Please don’t question why
My sins have been forgotten
I believe I’ll find peace in afterlife
Please don’t question why
I left this way

’Cause I can’t feel my face
I won’t struggle on
In a world so cold
In a world so wrong

I’m not running away, been fighting this so long (so long)
Such a price that we pay, we gotta be so strong
And I take my life tonight ’cause I have the right to die how I wanna
And leave how I arrived, so alive
(Alive)
