Caught up in this madness, too blind to see
Woke animal feelings in me
Took over my sense and I lost control
I’ll taste your blood tonight

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it’s too late, you’ve wasted all your time, yeah

Relax while you’re closing your eyes to me
So warm as I’m setting you free
With your arms by your side, there’s no struggling
Pleasure’s all mine this time

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it’s too late, you’ve wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there’s silence
Scream while there’s life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

We’ve all had a time where we’ve lost control
We’ve all had our time to grow
I’m hoping I’m wrong, but I know I’m right
I’ll hunt again one night

You know I make you wanna scream
You know I make you wanna run from me, baby
But know it’s too late, you’ve wasted all your time

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there’s silence
Scream while there’s life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

Some live repressing their instinctive feelings
Protest the way we’re built, don’t point the blame on me

Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your body
Scream, scream, scream
The way you would if I ravaged your mind

Cherishing those feelings, pleasuring
Cover me, unwanted clemency

Scream till there’s silence
Scream while there’s life left, vanishing
Scream from the pleasure
Unmask your desire, perishing

(In this madness, this madness, this madness, this madness)
(I lost control, in this madness, in this madness)
(I’ll hunt again one night, in this madness, this madness)
(I’ll hunt again one night)
