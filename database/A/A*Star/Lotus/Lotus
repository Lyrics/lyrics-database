(Out of sight) We’re delighted you’re coming to meet us
(Out of sight) Where the atmosphere is sweetest
(Don’t be shy) Let me give you this to believe in
(Don’t be shy) To be taken when you need it

Go with me, you will learn to love
All you see in oblivion
Don’t need to be anyone
When you let the lotus in, let it in

(Dynamite) We are dreaming and dreaming in color
(Dynamite) Ideology like no other
(Every night) It’s an indescribable lover
(Every night) Who has given you another

Go with me, you will learn to love
All you see in oblivion
Don’t need to be anyone
When you let the lotus in, let it in

(Get it right) If it seems like we all are just grieving
(Get it right) Virtuality is deceiving
(You and I) We are only living in Eden
(You and I) We don’t have to live with our demons

Go with me, you will learn to love
All you see in oblivion
Don’t need to be anyone
When you let the lotus in, let it in
