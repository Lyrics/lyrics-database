Look-see, look-see, I grow so tall
Who’s gonna cry when I make you fall?

Precious words can never take you
To the love of another time
No, I won′t beg ’cause you can’t hear me
I reach out, but the love can′t heal the crime

I see you looking through me
My scream silenced by your call
My hands try to touch you, but there’s nothing
Nothing there but your wall

I roam where we once lived, I die another day
No touch now to soothe the heartaches
Of the lovers that come my way
Through time

Look-see, look-see, I grow so tall
Who’s gonna cry when I make you fall?
Cry-baby, cry-baby, you’re gonna sprawl
No one′s gonna care, yeah here I crawl?

Look-see, look-see, I grow so tall
Who’s gonna cry when I make you fall?
Cry-baby, cry-baby, you’re gonna sprawl
No one′s gonna care, yeah here I crawl?

I roam where we once lived, I die another day
No touch now to soothe the heartaches
Of the lovers that come my way
Through time, through time

Look-see, look-see, I grow so tall
Who’s gonna cry when I make you fall?
Cry-baby, cry-baby, you’re gonna sprawl
No one′s gonna care, yeah here I crawl?

Look-see, look-see, I grow so tall
Who’s gonna cry when I make you fall?
Cry-baby, cry-baby, you’re gonna sprawl
No one′s gonna care, yeah here I crawl?
