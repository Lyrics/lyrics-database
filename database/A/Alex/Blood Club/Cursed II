Now that we′ve come this far
I bet their eyes are watching us move
Burning the candle twice as bright
As we intended to

Don’t fight it, or else it won′t come true
Such thoughts were much too flawed for you
I need you to try to understand
If you’re to take my hand

Constrict the voice that says, “it′s just a joke”
Restricted feelings at the base of the oak
I know there’s something that you cast on me
So should we set it free?

Ah…
Ah…

You came and put a curse on me

Now that we′ve come this far
I bet their eyes are watching us move
Burning the candle twice as bright
As we intended to

Don’t fight it, or else it won′t come true
Such thoughts were much too flawed for you
I need you to try to understand
If you’re to take my hand

Constrict the voice that says, “it′s just a joke”
Restricted feelings at the base of the oak
I know there’s something that you cast on me
So should we set it free?

You came and put a curse on me
