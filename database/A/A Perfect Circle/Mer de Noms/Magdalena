Overcome by your moving temple
Overcome by this holiest of altars
So pure, so rare,
To witness such an unearthly goddess
That I’ve lost my self-control
Beyond compelled to throw this dollar
Down before your
Holiest of altars

I’d sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my Magdalena

I bear witness to this place,
This prayer, so long forgotten
So pure, so rare
To witness such an unearthly goddess

That I’d sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one chance, one kiss,
One taste of you, my black Madonna

I’d sell my soul, my self-esteem
A dollar at a time
For one taste, one taste,
One taste of you, my Magdalena
