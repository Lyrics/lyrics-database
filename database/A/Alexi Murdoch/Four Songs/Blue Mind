Got no time 
Got no mind 
For the line 
In my life 
No time to think 
Time for sleep now 
Time to sink way into the blue, dear 

Got no time 
Got no mind 
For the line 
In this life 
No time to think 
Time for sleep now 
Time to sink way into the blue, dear 

So watch your time 
Time descends 
Let it spill quietly 
From your hands 
Oh, and the time is at hand 
When all things under the sky 
Go free of time 
Time is passing you by 
Got no time 
And I am drifting 
Yes, I am drifting 

Remember when you were only a child 
Remember when you were only a child 
Remember when you were only a child 
Start to see with your blue mind 
Start to see with your blue mind 
Don't be afraid of what you find 
No, don't be afraid of what you find 
(Don't stop your heart) 
Cause I am drifting 
Yes, I am drifting 
Slowly, slowly I am drifting 
Slowly, slowly I am drifting 
Yes, slowly, slowly I am drifting
