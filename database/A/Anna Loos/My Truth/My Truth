You poke your nose while I watch you
I wonder if you want me to touch you
There’s something behind your eyes
That makes you so televise
Sex machine is a real floor filler
TV screen is a serial killer
I’ve seen it all, but it’s not real
It’s not like the way I feel
My feet moving to your direction
Let me show you my affection
What comes after hardcore?
What comes after hardcore?

Stop, turn ’round
Keep quiet, get down
Relax, don’t move
Just feel my truth
I’m sorry (so sorry)
I didn’t mean to make you cry
I’m sorry (so sorry)
Let me sing you a lullaby

I don’t like this penetration
But it’s just a situation
Getting to know you real good
Wanting to show you my truth
I’m not the girl I used to be
With monkey bar on a tree
I’m in the middle of a scenery
It’s paradise for you and me
What comes after hardcore?

Stop, turn ’round
Keep quiet, get down
Relax, don’t move
Just feel my truth
I’m sorry (so sorry)
I didn’t mean to make you cry
I’m sorry (so sorry)
Let me sing you a lullaby

Stop, turn ’round
Keep quiet, get down
Relax, don’t move
Just feel my truth

Stop, turn ’round
Keep quiet, get down

I’m sorry…
