Just one touch and this enough
Just one kiss and you’re so happy
It’s enough than only words
It’s a never-dying stuff

Someone say it’s ok
Someone say I’m a joker
Try to trust me, I’m in love
This is feel not under smoke

Way to place you’ve never been
Place you have a heaven heading
I’ve been sitting, just for you looking
Let be sure you’ll never leave me
