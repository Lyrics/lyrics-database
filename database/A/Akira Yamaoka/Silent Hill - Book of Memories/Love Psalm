This isn’t the life that I dreamed
It could be
I’m staring into the eyes of the shell
Left of me

And now every decision I make
The good, the pleasure and the pain
Could simply all be erased
If I choose it to be

This nightmare unfolds like a rose awakes to the spring
Always so close to the sanity I’m trying to cling to
I’m tearing out the pages ’cause it hurts
To be forced to feel the heart’s break
How much of this torture can I take?
Is it not worth the risk to create
Just one more try
I know that I can fix it

If you could rewrite our life any way that you please
Would you tear out the pages of our memories?
Would you take back the pain and all the hurt we create?
Or could you be satisfied with the love that you’ve made with me?

If you could rewrite our life any way that you please
Would you tear out the pages of our memories?
Would you take back the pain and all the hurt we create?
Or could you be satisfied with the promise you made?

So we rewrite our lives, but it’s not what we think
In the chaos we dance, as we stand on the brink
Always one change away from making ourselves complete
The world will perish in flames and I’ll watch as you fade from me

We write our love psalm
Rewrite our love psalm
We write our love psalm
Rewrite our love psalm
