Tell me all the things you see
Lately, I have come to dream
Of birdless skies, their silent cries
In this empty box, where my heart is lost

Once blind by the fears we hide
Fragile like a wounded child
The maze of life, we fall behind
In this empty box, where your heart is lost

One day, when you run away
From all the pain that you face
You’re as lonely when you come to see
That the truth is never seen

Same old memories when we fall asleep
Among the burning dreams
Make you believe in the silent screams
When they whisper in your sleep

La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
La, la-la, la-la, la-la

One day, when you run away
From all the pain that you face
You’re as lonely when you come to see
That the truth is never seen

Same old memories when we fall asleep
Among the burning dreams
Make you believe in the silent screams
When they whisper in your s—

One day, when you run away
From all the pain that you face
You’re as lonely when you come to see
That the truth is never seen

Same old memories when we fall asleep
Among the burning dreams
Make you believe in the silent screams
When they whisper, “come to me”
