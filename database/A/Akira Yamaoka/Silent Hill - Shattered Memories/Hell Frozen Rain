In your mind’s eye
Lives a memory hard to find
Blinded by sorrow
And her cold voice sings a melody
Hear her sing
Hell frozen rain falls down

She can’t hear your voice
She can’t hear you call
You have earned your choice
If you’re here, can you prove you’re really here?

There is a moment in time
When all the cards that you’ve played divide (divide)
You feel the temperature dive
And all your demons inside come crashing through

In your mind’s eye
Lives a memory hard to find
Blinded by sorrow
And a strange voice sings a melody
Hear it sing
Hell frozen rain falls down

Everything is wrong (everything is wrong)
This is not my home, is it?
Do I know your face? (do I know your face?)
Does my mind wish to forget?

A toast to lonely souls
Who never could take control of life
And all the missing we love
I hope the darkness they fight will give them light

In your mind’s eye
Lives a memory hard to find
Blinded by pain
And a cold voice sings a melody
Hear it sing
Hell frozen rain

Are her safe arms feeling dangerous?
Missing truth frozen in lies
Is your family just a memory?
Once again
Hell frozen rain falls down

Of all these pieces of broken dreams
There’s one that scares and confuses me
If all these things that you say are true
You should be someone I always knew

In your mind’s eye
Lies a memory hard to find
Blinded by pain
And your father sings a melody
Hear him sing
Hell frozen rain

Are her safe arms feeling dangerous?
Missing truth frozen in lies
Are your loved ones
Just a memory burned in pain?
Hell frozen rain falls down

Down

Life is cold here
Empty hallowed ground in my head
Blood colored rain falls down
