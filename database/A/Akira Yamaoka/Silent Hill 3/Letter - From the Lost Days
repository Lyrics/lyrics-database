A letter to my future self,
Am I still happy, I began.
Have I grown up pretty?
Is Daddy still a good man?
Am I still friends with Coleen?
I’m sure that I’m still laughing,
aren’t I, aren’t I?

Hey there to my future self,
If you forget how to smile,
I have this to tell you,
Remember it once in a while:
Ten years ago your past self,
Prayed for your happiness,
Please don’t lose hope.

Oh, oh what a pair me and you,
Put here to feel joy, not be blue.
Sad times and bad times, see them through.
Soon we will know, if it’s for real what we both feel.

Though I can’t know for sure how things worked out for us,
No matter how hard it gets, you have to realize:
We weren’t put on this earth to suffer and cry,
We were made for being happy,
so, be happy, for me, for you, please.

Oh, oh what a pair me and you,
Put here to feel joy, not be blue.
Sad times and bad times, see them through.
Soon we will know, if it’s for real what we both feel.

We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy.
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy.
We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy.
(We were put here on this earth, put here to feel joy.)
