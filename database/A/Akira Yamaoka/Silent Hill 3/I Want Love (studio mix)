Alright, let’s do this
1, 2, 3, 4

I want a cup that overflows with love
Although it’s not enough to fill my heart

I want a barrel full of love
Although I know it’s not enough to fill my heart

I want a river full of love
But then I know the holes will still remain

I need an ocean full of love
Although I know the holes will still remain

And this Swiss cheese heart knows
Only kindness can fill its holes
I’d love to dry my tears
As pain disappears

I need a miracle and not someone’s charity
One drop of love from him and my heart’s in ecstasy
The high that is sending me is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone’s charity now

Fill up my heart with love
Oh. you’d be amazed at how
Little I need from him
To feel complete here and now
Stirring within me are these feelings I can’t ignore
I need a miracle and that’s what I’m hoping for

I need a miracle and not someone’s charity
One drop of love from him and my heart’s in ecstasy
The high that is sending me is most likely ending me
I need a miracle and not someone’s charity now

Anybody’s love but his
Will never fill this place within me now
Doctor, give me what I need
To free my heart from misery
