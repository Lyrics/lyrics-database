Your gentle voice I hear
Your words echo inside me
You said you long for me
And that you love me

And I want to see you too
Feels just like I’m falling
Is there nothing I can do?
Wonder if you hear my calling

I’m here and waiting for you
Where are you? — I can’t find you
I’m here and waiting for you
I’ll wait forever for you

Mom’s gone to heaven now
Why won’t she come back down?
Does she have someone she loves more than me?
I thought I could love you better
We were always together
If we took some time apart
You would finally know my heart

I’m here and waiting for you
Where are you? — I can’t find you
I’m here and waiting for you
I’ll wait forever for you

I fell in love with you
And now you’re gone
There’s nothing left within my lonely room
Without you

I’m here and waiting for you
Where are you? — I can’t find you
I’m here and waiting for you
I’ll wait forever for you

I’m here and waiting for you
Where are you? — I cannot, I cannot find you!
I’m waiting for you
Where are you?
Where are you?
