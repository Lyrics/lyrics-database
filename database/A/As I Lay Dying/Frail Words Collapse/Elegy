(to Stephanie for undying friendship)

did you ever see me
or could you even see at all
i looked at your cold white face
so still, so empty
yet i knew you were at rest
much more comforted than I
what else could i find to replace who you were
it was the carefree unrestricted love that you

never meant to give
you never had the choice,

it was your innocence
it was part of who you were
it was the comfort of a friend
