94 hours of regret for me to realize what I held
Unfading beauty, not just a face
I held its innocence within my heart

Go!
No, I won’t let go
I won’t let go
I won’t let go
No I, I won’t let go
No I, I won’t let go

The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul
The torment of your eyes has awakened my soul
The pain of a moment’s time will forever beg your forgiveness
Forgiveness

94 hours for me to realize
I held the unfading beauty
I held your innocence
