forever your eyes will hold the memory
i saw your heart as it overtook me
we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away

i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away

with that perfect breath where my mind lay beside me
and all i knew is what had overtaken me
with no reason i am comforted by inability to understand

forever your eyes will hold the memory
i saw your heart as it overtook me
we tried so hard to understand and reason
but in that one moment i gave my heart away

i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away
in that moment i gave my heart away

FOREVER your eyes will hold the memory
forever your eyes will hold the memory
forever your eyes will hold the memory

when i wake from this dream
will your smile still open my heart
and leave me transparent?
when i wake from this dream
will your smile still open my heart
and leave me transparent?
