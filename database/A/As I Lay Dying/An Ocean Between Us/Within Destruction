If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction comes from you for I have fallen
All that is hope within destruction comes from you for I have fallen, fallen

If music is a mirror revealing the depths of my heart
Then I will write the darkest song for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction comes from you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

For I have fallen and there is nothing good within me
Yet I’ve been given life I will, I will never deserve
For without forgiveness, for without forgiveness my soul is lost

All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction
All that is hope within destruction

All that is hope
All that is hope
All that is hope
All that is hope
