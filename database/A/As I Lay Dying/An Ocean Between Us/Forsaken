Yeahoh

I’ve looked straight into your eyes and turned my head for the last time
Because I was scared to leave these walls in ruin like the fate of those who trust in themselves
We are alone and afraid

I know YOU are the one we’ve left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU’re the one we’ve left behind
YOU’re the one we’ve left

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we’ve left behind
YOU are the forsaken

Yeah

We’ve built our confidence on broken dreams now left for dead
Yet we’ve been condemned, yet we’ve been condemnde to chase these dreams that never end

I know YOU are the one we’ve left behind
Yet somehow we are the ones who are alone
YOU’re the one we’ve left behind
YOU’re the one we’ve left behind

I will no longer turn my head
I will never forget YOU
YOU are the one we’ve left behind
YOU are the forsaken

I will, I will no longer turn my head
I will, I will never forget YOU
YOU are, YOU are the one we’ve left behind
YOU are, YOU are the forsaken

Our selfishness consumes us until the whole world is not enough
Forgive the day that I erased, that I erased YOUR name, that I erased YOUR name
For it’s the memory of me that will decay

I know YOU are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel alone
I know YOU are the forsaken
Somehow we are the ones who feel alone
