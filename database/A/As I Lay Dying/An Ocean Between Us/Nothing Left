Yeah, yeah

This world was never worthy but how can I call it unfaithful?
Every promise was fulfilled as decay crawled from its throat
Like the dead rising from an open grave
Like the dead rising from an open grave

Lips of splendor, tongue of deceit
All dying now as our fragile wrists hold only waste

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left

Nothing left, nothing left
There’s nothing left
Nothing left

If all my sorrow has led me here then I would cry all of my tears
To have this chance, to have this chance again
To have this chance, to have this chance
And know there’s more than this and know there’s more than you

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left

Like those gasping for their last breath
We cannot hide there’s nothing left
