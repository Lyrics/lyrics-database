We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape, and I say it's worth it to just start again… again.

We've focused so long on ideals of freedom that it is this very belief that oppresses us.
We all want to be free, yet we find ways to forfeit liberty
To our own impulses, to our own consumption.

So I say it's worth it to build a new foundation… a new foundation…
A new foundation… a new foundation… It's a past we cannot escape.

This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.
But what is control once we have let go of all we suffer? Once we've let go…

Yeah… When we've awakened to admit we are all enslaved,
Then there is freedom in our choice to disobey. Yeah…
Our creeds have become a justification (justification) to live the way that some see fit,
(justification) and no one is more hopeless than those blinded by the scales of content.

This vacancy will take everything this world can offer.
But what is control (what is control) once we have let go of all we suffer?

We live in slavery to a past we cannot escape. So I say it's worth it to just start again.

Oh… We've let go. We've let go. We've let go. Yeah…

This vacancy will take everything this world (all that this world) can offer
(all that this world offers).
But what is control (what is control) once we have let go (we have let go) of all we suffer?

We can't escape, we can't escape. We can't escape, we can't escape.
So I say it's worth it to start again.
