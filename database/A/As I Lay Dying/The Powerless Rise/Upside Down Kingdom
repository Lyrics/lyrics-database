Many choose to find their hope in the thoughts of afterlife
When there is none to be found right here before we die
So I understand the feeling of helplessness
When we are just taught to wait here, wait here for death

Wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end
Wait here for death, wait here for death
Wait for this suffering to end

We are not forgotten, for a kingdom is offered beyond that of golden streets
We can represent now what will one day be complete

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned

Wait here for death, wait here for death
The "blessings" of excess are only a burden on us

It is a broken system where we just wait for death
It is a broken system where suffering can never end

Simplicity is not a curse where strength is humbled
And the powerless rise (and the powerless rise)
This is a kingdom born upside-down
This is a kingdom where the broken are crowned, the broken are crowned

If helplessness is our system then we’re better off upside-down
