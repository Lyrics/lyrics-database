The only constant is change. The only constant is change. Go…

The human heart is born without legs, sliding back and forth,
And never once does it truly rest, unless accompanied by death… Sliding back and forth.

Even the strongest remnants of history, they have begun to crumble against time.
Sliding back and forth.

The only constant is change. Nothing remains the same.
The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay. Yea…

Let's go… Unvarying scenes only found in pictures can never breathe life.
For nowhere else does level ground exist, unless it has been captured by a flash of steady light.

Sliding back and forth (back and forth).
The only constant is change. Uncertainty awaits.
The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay… or decay.
The only constant is change…

There is nothing that stays the same, from the foundation of our lives.
There is nothing that stays the same. There is nothing to erase time…

The only constant is change. Nothing remains the same.
The only constant is change. There's only growth or decay… Yeaah…
The only constant is change (change). The only constant is change.
