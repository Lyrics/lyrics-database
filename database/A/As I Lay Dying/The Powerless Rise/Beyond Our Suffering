What we see now is only a fraction…

Bound to learn the hard way
This is the human condition
There is nothing that can be said
To stop us from making mistakes
When I look to myself as a source of ending pain
No matter how many times before I’ve failed

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond us to those truly in hell

The more I focus on myself
Then the more helpless that I become
So why not erase this point of view?
My suffering is trivial (Beyond our suffering)
Compared to those who know real agony

It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look beyond our suffering

My trials seem insignificant now

Why won’t we look beyond us?
Why won’t we look beyond our despair?
It seems our problems solve themselves
When we look to those truly in hell

Personal redemption cannot change the world
Unless we lay down our lives for those who still suffer
