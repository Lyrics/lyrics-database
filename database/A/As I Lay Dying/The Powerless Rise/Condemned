Yaahh…
Condemned… Condemned… Condemned… Condemned…
Condemned… without given a chance to speak.
Without acknowledgment they’re made less than human.

Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Trapped by… Trapped by obscurity.
Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Sentenced… Sentenced to neglect.

Ohhhh…
They will never share our blood, yet is that reason to
Drain what’s left of theirs, abandoning compassion?

Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Trapped by… Trapped by obscurity.
Condemned… Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Sentenced… Sentenced to neglect. Oh…

Why do we uphold allegiance higher than maintaining life?
The ties of blood breaking a stronger bind.

Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Trapped by… Trapped by obscurity.
Condemned… Condemned… Condemned to anonymity. Sentenced… Sentenced to neglect.
