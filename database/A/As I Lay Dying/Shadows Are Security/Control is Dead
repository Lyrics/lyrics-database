Control is dead in this blind world,
For we do what we hate.
Split from inside.
Betrayed by emotion.
We must look past what is in front of us.
Shadows are security.

They have become the solace of my looking glass heart.
In search for certainty, I no longer need control.

Take me through the fire, refine what is Yours.
It is time to overcome this.
We must look past what is in front of us.
