I have traveled so far to find so little
meaning in tragedy or tragedy
in the search for meaning
dark clouds have lead me here
confined freedom
guides us to security
what if everything
I have been taught is a lie and all of my teachers
have been wrong this whole time
compelling us to fight
the battles they would not
they have already won
and we have already lost
if we do not learn from their mistakes
we have already lost
if we don’t learn to change
