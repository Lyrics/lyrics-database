Can we die to live another day

how could we lose sight
of what matters most
trying to love
what cannot love us back
all we have is not worth living for
if we do not know when to let go
Can we die to live another day
what is this life
that we cling to it so tight
afraid that it will take from us
these fading sentiments
can we die to live another day
