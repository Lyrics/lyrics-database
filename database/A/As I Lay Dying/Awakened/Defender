Defender

Fighting so hard to be heard
Yet having nothing to say
You talk about changing masses
But forget those close to you

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

You can justify almost anything
If you are willing to be loud enough
But once you’ve spent everything
To change the world around you
Even if your voice is taken away
Such actions will still inspire

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

Drained
Spent
Determined
Intent
Now you’ve earned the right to be heard

We’ve been deceived by elegant speech
Whose only concern is mere distraction

Defender

Drained
Spent
Determined
Intent
Now you’ve earned the right to be heard

I will follow to the grave
A man who’s willing to die

Most of us have given up
On these words that all sound the same
But I am still willing to believe
If you have done all that you can

I am willing to die
Defender
