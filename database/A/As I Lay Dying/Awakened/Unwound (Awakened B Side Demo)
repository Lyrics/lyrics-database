I see no reason to try and be what I am not
If simple honesty moves me, then why should I care?
Others may think I lost my poetic way (I’ve lost my way)
But I’d rather make my point without confusion

I have failed those who I love the most
And in the process become aware

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations

It is that knowledge that opens the door
For greater understanding
Perspective on what is still untold

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I’ll never know
I have accepted my limitations

Sorting out my thoughts, that is why I write
Though I reveal my weakness surrendering is remedy
These songs have helped me though my greatest pain
Unwound within me the disorder of my life

I now see things for how they are
Even if that is a harsh reality

I have accepted there is so much that I don’t know
I have accepted my limitations
I have accepted there is so much that I’ll never know
I have accepted my limitations
