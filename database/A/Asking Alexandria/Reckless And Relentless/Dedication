You’ll never really find those perfect words
Something more than just… “Goodbye”

It’s hard to remember the good times when there’s just so much heartache
But they deserve more than that
They deserve more than just one single moment of sadness

So just remember that when there’s enough love in our hearts
To burst like a fucking supernova
And there sure as hell’s enough love in our heart to spark that famous smile

We all lose someone at some point in our lives
But don’t ever let go of that smile

Hold on forever
Because that’s our final dedication
