Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from the heart
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own
To call my own, to call my own

It was you
Who told me I could do this
You put the music in my heart
And now you sing with a band in Memphis
It's hard just to be strong
Not knowing if I've done you proud
I like to imagine
A smile when you hear my songs

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from my heart
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

A letter home
And I know we don't speak much
And we both know I'm not keen to
But I think there's things I've left unsaid
I'm okay, don't worry
I wish I'd been a better kid
I'm trying to slow down
I'm sorry for letting you down

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from my heart
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

Yeah

You know it's just rock and roll
I know you're by my side through it all
My terror twin and I
Let's take over the world

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from my heart
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own

Even though I'm on my own
I know I'm not alone
'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere
Praying that I make it home
So here's one from my heart
My life right from the start
I need a home sweet home
To call my own
