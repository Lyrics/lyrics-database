Music is fucking dead
It's thanks to you cunts stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and every one of these fake, righteous, undeserving bands
Fuck you

Through sin and self-destruction I stumble home, never alone
My only home is the bottom of a bottle and a rolled up bill and I'm ready to go
I live the same day in and out and I don't care how long I last
All the girls and drink and drugs, but don't get me wrong
I'm having a fucking blast

I am rock and roll
Living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Not gonna stop until my heart stops beating
Not gonna stop until my last breath comes
I'm gonna go until I hit the floor and I can't find a way back to my feet anymore

Pass me a glass and let's destroy everything in this fucking place
Life at 300 miles an hour
You pussies can't keep up with this fucking pace

I am rock and roll
Living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

Just like the cigarettes hurt
Just like the whiskey burns
I guess I'm never gonna learn

I've spent the last two years tearing apart my soul
I'll put the next two in to kick-start the good old days of rock and roll

Without a drink, without regret, without a second thought
You hit the nail on the head with the back of your fucking throat

I am rock and roll
Living a life you can only dream of
I am rock and roll at its fucking finest

Music is fucking dead
It's thanks to you cunts stabbing it in the fucking chest
You, and every one of these fake, righteous, undeserving bands
Fuck you
