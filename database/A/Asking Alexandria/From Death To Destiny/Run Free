This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, escape your inhibitions
Taste the wind, let your hair down and throw your hands up
Go, go, go, let go, forget the consequences
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
This world's yours for the taking
Run free

Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking
Open wide, scream it loud "This is my life"
Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before
Go, go, go, let go, running free

Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world
Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world

Close your eyes and pray for something bigger than this world has to give
Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next
Know that you went in the end without a single regret
That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams

You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid
Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles
Run free and wild, let your love take over
You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid
