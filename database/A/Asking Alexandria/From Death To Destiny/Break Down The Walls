Close your eyes and leave all your fears behind, it's alright
Close your eyes and follow me until the end
So if you're hopeless we can pick up the pieces
And if you're broken I can carry the pain
Are you with me? Watching the flames rise higher

Sing this with me

Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout 'til the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this, you can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground

Don't let go, we carry our torches high, always burning
We've come too far to throw it all away
So are you with me? Watching the flames rise higher

Sing this with me

Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout 'til the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this, you can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground

I light the match and watch it fall to the ground
As the embers rise and the smoke fills the air

Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
Scream and shout 'til the lights go out
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
We won't take this, you can't break us
We won't stop until the world is in our hands
Break down the walls, I want it all
I won't stop until I burn this to the ground
