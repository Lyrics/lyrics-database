Walking up and down abandoned streets
Lanterns hang high above me
As I make my way through the city
And it is here
I hear that voice so clear

On the foggy streets of San Francisco
I feel my heart breaking
And through the lonely streets of San Francisco
Inside I am aching
To be with you

You’re the ultimate my soul’s mercy
Your ministries make waves in me
Riddles the tide in me
And it is here
I hear that voice so clear

On the foggy streets of San Francisco
I feel my heart breaking
And through the lonely streets of San Francisco
Inside I am aching
To be with you

On the foggy streets of San Francisco
I feel my heart breaking
And through the lonely streets of San Francisco
Inside I am aching, I’m aching
To be with you
