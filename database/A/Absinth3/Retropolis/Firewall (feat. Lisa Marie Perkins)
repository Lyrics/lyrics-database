She’s a devil
She’s running down, killing one by one
Do you remember?
She’s got a .50 cal, so you better run

She’s a liar
She’d tell you that she loved you but it wasn’t so
And all the hatred
It all built up inside her and she’s letting it go

You better run
You better hide
’Cause she’s gonna come and find you and take you for a ride

You better stop
You better think
There’s no more time to run ’cause she’s on the brink

No turning down
Don’t turn around
Just find somewhere to hide and don’t make a sound

She’s coming in
You can’t win
’Cause when she gets you in the night you won’t believe your eyes

(Firewall)
She won’t give in tonight
You better run or you will feel the

(Firewall)
She won’t give up the fight
You better hide or you will get the

(Firewall)
Empress of the night
You better watch or you will see the

(Firewall)
Her lights are shining bright
Hunt you down and you will not see her
You will not see her

[Hello?]
[I’m sorry, but your time is up]

You better run
You better hide
’Cause she’s gonna come and find you and take you for a ride

You better stop
You better think
There’s no more time to run ’cause she’s on the brink

No turning down
Don’t turn around
Just find somewhere to hide and don’t make a sound

She’s coming in
You can’t win
’Cause when she gets you in the night you won’t believe your eyes

(Firewall)
She won’t give in tonight
You better run or you will feel the

(Firewall)
She won’t give up the fight
You better hide or you will get the

(Firewall)
Empress of the night
You better watch or you will see the

(Firewall)
Her lights are shining bright
Hunt you down and you will not see her
You will not see her
