There’s a look on your face I would like to knock out
See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
All I want is to see you in terrible pain
Though we won’t ever meet I remember your name

Can’t believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
But I don’t think I can so fuck you anyway

You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
Now the world needs to see that it’s time you should go
There’s no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow

Can’t believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don’t think I can, so fuck you anyway

Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
So much crap coming out, it must take you all day

There’s a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
When you look at yourself do you see what I see
If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?

There’s a time for us all and I think yours has been
Can you please hurry up ’cause I find you obscene
We can’t wait for the day that you’re never around
When that face isn’t here and you rot underground

Can’t believe you were once just like anyone else
Then you grew and became like the devil himself
Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
But I don’t think I can so fuck you anyway

So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
So fuck you anyway
