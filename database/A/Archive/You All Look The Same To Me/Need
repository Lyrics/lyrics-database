You’ve got time, time on your hands
Bury your head in the sand
Take your time, hurry it up
Guess you’ll sit there and just drift away

You’ve got worries more than enough
Course it’s rough yes I know that it’s tough
All that time, time on your hands
Guess you’ll sit there and just drift away

I need to know
What they’re saying ain’t true about you
I need to know
There’s a little hope inside of you
But there might, might not be

Oh my baby please look me up
When you feel that you’ve had enough
You were mine, I was yours
Set to see and now drift away

I need to know
What they’re saying ain’t true about you
I need to know
There’s a little hope inside of you and
I need to know
What they’re saying ain’t true about you
I need to know
There’s a little hope inside of you
But there might, might not be
Might not be
Might not be
Might not be
