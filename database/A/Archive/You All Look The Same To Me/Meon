Does anybody want to take me on?
Does anybody want to hear the things I have to say?
I fear today

Does anybody want to see me cry?
If I’m the only one I’d rather die

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to see me smile?
Does anybody want to open up and see what’s vile?
Sometimes it’s like it’s said
Sometimes it’s throw away

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to take me on?
Does anybody want to see me die?
When he cries, throws away

Thoughtless baby
Thoughtless baby

Does anybody want to see me cry?
If I’m the only one I’d rather die

Thoughtless baby
I’d rather die

Does anybody want to take me on?
Does anybody want to take me on?
Does anybody want to take me on?
Does anybody want to take me on?
