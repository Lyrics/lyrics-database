’Cause I’m a fool
A fool to you
I seem to want
Everything that you do
I don’t know
I procrastinate
Cause I hate those days
That are bound to me

It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
So climb out
It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
So climb out
Climb out
It always hurts

Tell me why
Did you fall
Over me
I let my heart implode
I let my heart
My heart implode
I let my faith go

It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
So climb out
It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts

Climb, climb out
Climb out
Climb out

It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
It’s never sure
It’s never pure
It always hurts
