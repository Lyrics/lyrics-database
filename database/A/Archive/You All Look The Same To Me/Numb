(Numb, numb…)

You put a hope through me
I put a hope through you
You put a hope through me
You put a hope through me
You put a hope through me
I put a hope through you
You put a hope through me
I put a hope through you

I put a hope through you
I put a hope through you
(Numb, numb…)
You put a hope through me

’Cause I’m numb
’Cause I’m numb
