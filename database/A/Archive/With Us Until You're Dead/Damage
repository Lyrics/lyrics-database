You’re out of your mind
Cuts show nothing at all
Scars show nothing at all

(You’re out of you’re mind)

Cuts show nothing at all
Scars show nothing at all
Damage shows nothing at all

You’re out of your mind

Carnage here to see
Damage here to feel
Bruised and bashed you’re done

(You’re out of you’re mind)
Thrown and thrashed you’re done
You really got nothing to see
You really got nothing to say

Come on and break us down
Come on and break us down
Come on and make this easy for me

Leaving me wrecked inside
Turning the outside broken
Tell everyone it’s bright
Tell everyone it’s open

You’re out of your mind
You’re out of your mind
You’re out of your mind

Come on and freak us out
Come on make us crazy
Come on, you’re freaking us out
Come on, you’re driving me crazy

Pulling me back inside
Leaving me dark and distant
Pulling me back outside
Keeping it dark and distant

You don’t have a prayer in sight
You’re out of your rotten mind
You don’t have a hope or a prayer now
You’re out of your twisted rotten mind

You’re out of your mind
You’re out of your mind
You’re out of your mind
