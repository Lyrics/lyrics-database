Conflict is inevitable like control and fear
Conflict is integral say goodbye my dear
Conflict is inevitable like control and death
Conflict is integral this is the end I said

Conflict is inevitable see it in your mind
Conflict is what makes us here it’s so easy to find
Conflict is inevitable attack inside your head
Conflict is a part of us with us until we’re dead

Conflict is inevitable the crash and it all comes down
Conflict is in everything in us and all around
Conflict is inevitable a force inside your heart
Conflict is integral let’s prepare to part
