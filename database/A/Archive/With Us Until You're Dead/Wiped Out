Drowned out
Washed out
You cried
In front of me

I wrote a note
A lying note
You died in front of me

I broke my promise
And tore what we had
Watch out
My angel
My love
Watch out
My love

Wiped out
Reeling
You died in front of me

We ripped it wide open
Words used as knives
Watch out
My angel
My love
Watch out

My love
