It's in the paper every day
I see it in the headlines and I feel so sick, yeah
As another life leaves this world (this world) so full of hate
But short
Short on compassion
Short on humanity
Asking myself in vain, shaken by the shock,
"Do we even have a chance?"

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

This is a plea for peace (world peace)
To the oppressors of the world and to,
To the leaders of nations, corporate profit takers,
to the everyday citizen
Greed, envy, fear, hate - the competition has to stop.
When you see someone down, now's the time to pick them up
Set your differences aside and never look back, no

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
It's time to prove it.

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

Isn't everybody tired of the fighting? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the killing? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the dying? (hey, hey)
Isn't everybody tired of the hatred? (hey, hey)
Violence (hey, hey)…  fighting (hey)…  killing (hey)… dying (hey)… aaaaaaah!

(excerpt from Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech:)
So even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow,
I still have a dream
we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children,
black men and white men
Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing
"Free at last, free at last.
Thank God Almighty, we are free at last."

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human
It's time to prove it.

I don't wanna die
(I don't wanna kill)
I don't wanna kill
(I don't wanna die)
We are all human.
Let's start to prove it.

We are all human
It's time to prove it.
We are all human…
