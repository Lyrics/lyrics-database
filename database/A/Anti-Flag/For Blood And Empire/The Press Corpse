The Downing Street memo says…

…We gotta work to make the facts fit the false charges
Pull the wool over the eyes of the filthy masses
Stab the people in the back for the corporate choice
Roll the propaganda out using The People’s Voice

We don’t want to talk about it…

The press scribble scribble every half-truth spoke
Then shoot it round the country like an April Fools joke
Hype the nation for a Desert Storm love affair
Wave the stars and stripes like you just don’t care!

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don’t want to… talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don’t want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Ohhhhh, whoa!

And on the TV screen…
…Diversion and aversion is the flavor of the day
Was it WMDs? Or Democracy?
Blame it on MI-6 or the CIA
The White House Press Corpse only has one thing to say…

"We don’t want to talk about it!"

The White House boils over, "Al Jazeera got it wrong!"
The Press Corpse jumps onboard singing the White House song
While over in Iraq thousands are dead because of lies
The spineless war drumming-press corpse have taken lives

They talk it up all day, they talk it up all night
They talk until their face turns blue - Red white and blue!
But when the truth escapes the night and crawls into the day
We find the picture still askew

They don’t want to… talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and mindlessly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don’t want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Ohhhhh, whoa!

1, 2, 3, 4!
1, 2, 3, 4!

Fires fueled on endless lies
Black shrouds coat desert skies
A nation’s viewpoint blurred and led
As embeds report what they’re fed

We don’t want to talk about it…
We don’t want to talk about it…
We don’t want to talk about it…
We don’t want to talk about it…

(We don’t want to talk about it…)
We don’t, don’t want to, we don’t wanna talk about it
(We don’t want to…)
We don’t, don’t want to, we don’t wanna talk

They don’t want to… talk talk talk talk talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute
Oh! Whoa!
They don’t want to talk about it
They wanna tiptoe, walk around it
Wave the flag and cowardly salute

Ohhhhh, whoa!
