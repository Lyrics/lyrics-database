See our sense of shame and throw it overboard
See our moral compass set to so past bored
I guess conscience really does just make cowards of us all
See us turn a blind eye till it’s criminal
See us walk away until we can’t walk anymore
I guess conscience really does just make us look like fools

You’ve been washing out the faces of your friends again

See us right the ship, take back control
See us fight like hell for the way it was before
I guess judgement really should just come from our enemies

You’ve been washing out the faces of your friends
You’ve been wishing that they’d give you another chance again
