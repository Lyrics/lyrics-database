Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned
Don't mask your pride with humility
While forcing others to keep proving their loyalty

You've been a hypocrite for years
Drawing swords as much as you draw their tears
Demand what you will never deserve
Respect is gained by trust shown and earned

You build your strength off of your anger
Fighting a selfish battle with no answer
Your transparency has started showing
Don't let fear guide you where you are going

You would die for everyone else
But you won't live for yourself

Do you mean what you say?
Do you say what you mean
Or will you find another lie
Another lie to hide behind?
Keep speaking to the world about
What you can't forget
You can't forget all the things you hold onto
Refusing to forgive those that hurt you

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized
When the heart's intent is full of pride

You're taking steps on a fine line
So you don't have to choose a side
Good deeds are not recognized
When the heart's intent is full of pride
One day we hope you stop holding it on all in
And learn to let go and forgive (Forgive)
