Do you know how it feels to hide
With thoughts repressed deep down inside?
I guess you just loved the lie
Truth is, you can't decide where my heart resides

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
And cast aside from the man that I am

I've never felt so free
It kills me to hear you say you "choose to love me"
I was hoping that would be a given, given our history
I've never felt so free, so free

You think I'm wrong, you think I'm wrong
But I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better
Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

I know I disappointed you
But I've got nothing to prove

You want to cure me of this epidemic, you call me sick
I wish I had said it, the words to admit to you who I am
My entire life I was dealt the wrong hand
But now I've realized this is who I am
I've made my decision, you're either with or against me

You're either with or against me
You're either with or against me

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie
I thought blood was thicker than water
You think I'm wrong but I never felt better

Stop living in denial, stop loving the lie

I'm standing firm, it's who I am
You can't keep me, you can't keep me down
I'm moving on, I'm living free
You can't stop me, you can't stop me now

I'm standing firm, it's who I am
You can't keep me, you can't keep me down
I'm moving on, I'm living free
You can't stop me, you can't stop me now
