I walk along the avenue
I never thought I’d meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
You hypnotize me through

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn’t get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora Borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day
I couldn’t get away

Reached out a hand to touch your face
You’re slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I’m floating in a beam of light with you
A beam of light with you

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I ran all night and day

And I ran
I ran so far away
I just ran
I couldn’t get away
