This is when your flesh
Crimson and pale
Withers behind the blackened veil

The vacant flesh
A petrifying look
The choice is easy
The outcome always the same

The shortest way to cardiac arrest

The flesh that dreams are made of
Doesnâ€™t last

This is when you turn
To sanctimonious rituals

The duty of the beast

The duty of the beast

The duty of the beast
