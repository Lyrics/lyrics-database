This is when your flesh
Crimson and pale
Withers behind the blackened veil

The vacant flesh
A petrifying look
The choice is easy
The outcome always the same

The shortest way to cardiac arrest

The flish that dreams are made of
Doesn’t last

This is when you turn
To sanctimonious rituals

The duty of the beast

The duty of the beast

The duty of the beast
