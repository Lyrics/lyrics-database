Condemned to death by his peers for rebellion
Horus from Hierakonpolis, the God of Heavens,
has seven days to see the Earth of mankind once more.

The Earth he helped create.

Seven days; the time for one beat of the divine heart.
Not a second more before being deprived of his immortality;
but even the Gods fear death.
