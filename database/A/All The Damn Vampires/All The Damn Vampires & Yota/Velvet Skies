It’s getting harder to control the forces in me
They’re sending shivers down my spine when you are near me
Repeating images all over me of velvet skies

You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
And I can’t control it
Can’t control it

Oh, in a dream there was a scene, a horror movie
The devil’s running after me and I was falling
And there you stand and take my hand and tell me I’ll be fine
(That’s when I knew you would be mine)
(Mine, mine)

The shades of grey under the moon are quite appealing
Deep in the night I see a face slowly appearing
Beneath the light it’s you and I until the day we die
(That day you’ll know why)

You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
And I can’t control it
Can’t control it

Control it, no
I just can’t control it
Control it, control it, control it, control it
Control it, control it, control it, control it

You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
You make me lose my mind
And I can’t control it
Can’t control it
