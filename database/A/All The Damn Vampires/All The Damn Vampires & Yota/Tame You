Steep roads down
We are mountains above the sky
Through high and low
I’m your driver, I’ll take you home

I’ll chase you
I’ll run through all those fences and I’ll tame you
’Cause you’re wild
I’ll take you…

I’ll be the one who knows
The one who won’t let go
You’re mine, I’m yours
From here forever

I’ll chase you
I’ll run through all those fences and I’ll tame you
’Cause you’re wild
I’ll take you
I’ll tear your fear in pieces and I’ll show you
How to fly

Tame now
Here comеs the rain
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
I’ll chase you
I’ll tame you
Tamе

I’ll chase you
I’ll run through all those fences and I’ll tame you
’Cause you’re wild
I’ll take you
I’ll tear your fear in pieces and I’ll show you
Oh, how to fly
