I still can see it clearly
When I am standing in the dark
Though you’re far
Imagining him near me
Like we had never been apart
From the start

I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go
Never, no-oh
I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go
Never, no-oh-oh-oh

Sometimes I think you hear me
You hear them calling in your sleep
That is me
We’ll see those fences falling
And they will bring you back to sleep
What I mean

I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go
Never, no-oh
I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go
Never, no-oh-oh-oh

Time goes by
But I’m still here

I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go (hey-ey-ey-ey-ey)
Never, no-oh
I wanted just to let you know
I’m never gonna let this go (oh-oh-oh)
Never, no-oh-oh-oh
