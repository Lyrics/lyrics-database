The sound of your name upon my heart
Has left a stain.

And I know that we must say goodbye,
But without you inside my heart may die.

But I don’t want the perfect rose,
The one you say that I deserve.
All I know is that I loved you.
Hold you when you cry,
Without you I would rather die.

And I have done everything that I can do,
But I just can’t keep you.

And I don’t want the perfect rose,
The one you say that I deserve.
All I know is that I loved you.
Hold you when you cry,
Without you I would rather die.

And I am not the perfect rose,
The one I think that you deserve.
All I know is that I love you…
I love you.
