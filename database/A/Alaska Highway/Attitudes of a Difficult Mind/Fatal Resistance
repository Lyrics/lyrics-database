Vile person, leave me twisted
Your light has left the sun
Now we meet to end our hatred
The war of spell has just begun

Hope becomes so hopeless
(Tonight someone is going to die)
Your fatal resistance
(Either you or I)
Affection, infection
(Tonight someone is going to die)
(Either you or I)

Wretched corpse, you leave me wanting
The life inside of you to drain
Resurrect my dormant anger
For my pleasure is inside your pain

Hope becomes so hopeless
(Tonight someone is going to die)
Your fatal resistance
(Either you or I)
Affection, infection
(Tonight someone is going to die)
(Either you or I)

Hope becomes so hopeless
(Tonight someone is going to die)
Your fatal resistance
(Either you or I)
Affection, infection
(Tonight someone is going to die)
Hope becomes so hopeless
(Either you or I)

Your fatal resistance
(Tonight someone is going to die)
Affection, infection
(Either you or I)

(Tonight someone is going to die)
(Either you or I)
(Tonight someone is going to die)
(Tonight someone is going to die)
