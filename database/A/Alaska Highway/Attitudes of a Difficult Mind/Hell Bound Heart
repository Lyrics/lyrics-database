I want to see you chained upon the wall
Wanna see your flesh rip, tear as you fall
What would you give to touch my skin?
What would I give to know what hides within?

Inside your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
Where your suffering tastes so sweet
Here you’re nothing but the victim at my feet

I want to keep you away from the peace
The one that you deprived me before I had deceased
And what reason could you give for my death?
You’re an angel killer, don’t waste your breath

It was your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here with me you will stay
And with your mind games I will play
When your suffering tastes so sweet
You’ll be nothing but the victim at my feet

It was your hell bound heart that tore me apart
Now here in hell I will stay
And with my mind games they will play
Where my suffering tastes so sweet
Here I’m nothing but the victim at their feet

(Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing)
