An attraction to such discomfort arises from within.
And when all words are spoken this tension is released.
This beauty’s metamorphosis into a beast.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh,
Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh,
Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin.

Can you deny what festers so passionately inside?
Slaughter the necromancer that resurrects your bride.
Can these intentions penetrate a lover’s lie?
Taste the lips of the moment and allow the soul to die.

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh, (lust for your body)
Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin, (lust for your body)

Give in to your heart, (lust for your body)
Give in to your flesh, (lust for your body)
Give in to your skin, (lust for your body)
Give in to your sin. (lust for your body)
