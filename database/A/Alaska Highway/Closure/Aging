Time had consumed me
Open liquid falls from my eye
To hope that I seek comfort
For my insignificant demise

To cloud all reason
And accept this pain
With my hands raised towards nothing
Screaming for your uncertain lingering

Aged and strayed
And I’ve lost my heart’s desire

Now I’ve made not we
This sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

To this destination
So far from my mind
Omens have brought me so deep
And decayed

Aged and strayed
And I’ve lost my heart’s desire

Now I bleed not we
My sacrifice you were
Too careless
To ever see

Aged and strayed
And I’ve lost my heart’s desire

And now I bleed not we
My sarcrifice you were
Too hopeless
To ever see

In sleep I find
No sympathy
And I’ve become
So numb

In the hour of passing
To this emptiness
I circle
