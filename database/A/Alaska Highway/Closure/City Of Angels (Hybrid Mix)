You can break all that you please,
Spread through me like some disease.
Retalliation comes with time,
Retribution shall be mine.

City Of Angels, I’ve returned,
The bridge I’ve crossed we now must burn.
Let them fall beneath your sky,
By the blade I live and die.

City Of Angels, fight with me,
Defend your heart and dignity.
Featured stars fall from the sky,
By the blade I live and die.

You’re the lamb to a slaughter,
Filthy ashes drowned in water.
Phoenix never to arise
In this place where all hope dies.

City Of Angels, I’ve returned,
The bridge I’ve crossed we now must burn.
Let them fall beneath the sky,
By the blade I live and die.

City Of Angels, fight with me,
Defend your heart and dignity.
Featured stars fall from the sky,
By the blade we live and die.

City Of Angels, I’ve returned,
The bridge I’ve crossed we now must burn.
Let them fall beneath the sky,
By the blade I live and die.

City Of Angels, fight with me,
Defend your heart and dignity.
Featured stars fall from the sky,
By the blade we live and die.
