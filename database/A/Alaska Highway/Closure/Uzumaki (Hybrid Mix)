Painted city
The mask she wears
Twelve feet under
Going down quickly

If that was me that you would leave
If a storm should come her way
If it breaks like my heart
You will seek as waters rise

Like the wind from the sea
Now to tear you all apart
In the distance what to do
To pray that you are safe from harm
XXX city fills with tears
Away from streets that drown tonight

Let the waters come
To test the vow you’ve made to me
Let the waters come
To break that vow

Upon the river front we stood
Waiting here
To bring you down
But I shall return again
To bring survivors to their end

Like the wind from the sea
Now to tear you all apart
In the distance what to do
To pray that you are safe from harm
XXX city fills with tears
Away from streets that drown tonight

Let the waters come
To test the vow you’ve made to me
Let the waters come
To break that vow

Let the waters come
To break that vow
