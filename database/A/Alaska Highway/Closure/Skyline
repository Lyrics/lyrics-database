Here the buildings
Are higher than the ones you’ve known.
And it’s much darker on this side,
See why my heart I had to hide.

It’s in this place
I may be some prince, some king, some freak.
But it means nothing without your hand
Here in mine.

But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go,
Inside my mind it’s still not free.

Here I’m stronger.
No emotions to bring me down.
But what is it a heart
If we don’t tear it apart
In a masquerade of game we play?

The lights above us,
These towers we could never climb.
You once were a star to lead me away
From the pain within my own decay.

But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go,
Inside my mind it’s still not free.

But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you

But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.
But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go,
Inside my mind it’s still not free.

But tonight I’m going to the city
To forget you.
To forget you.
To forget you.
To forget you.
