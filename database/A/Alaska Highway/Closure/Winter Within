Knights empowered are now frozen,
And the storm has filled the black hole of your heart.

To meet her, watch her flowers wither
While you’re here though you’re not my prisoner
For you’re always free to go
To bring the spring that melts the snow

Can you sense the seasons change
From the touch of my skin?
Do you feel the shiver beneath
From this winter within?

Now I grab this time to pass
Through labyrinths of ice that lead to the day
But you’ll return to me, my love
And choose death as your way

The two half-cups will bring us closer,
But the two half-swords will tear us apart again.
Frozen phoenix, rise through the feeling
That inside of me awaits your healing.
I was never yours, you were never mine,
Though our souls forever intertwine.

Can you sense the seasons change
From the touch of my skin?
Do you feel the shiver beneath
From this winter within?

Now I grab this time to pass
Through labyrinths of ice that lead to the day
But you’ll return to me, my love
And choose death as your way
