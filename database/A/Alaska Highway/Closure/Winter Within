Knights empowered are now frozen,
And the storm has filled the black XXX of your heart.

...
While you’re here you’re not my prisoner
For you’re always free to go
To bring the spring that melts the snow

Can you sense the seasons change
From the touch of my skin?
Do you feel the shiver beneath
From this winter within?

Now I grab this time to pass
... to the day
But you’ll return to me my love
And choose death as your way

The two half-cups will bring us closer,
But the two half-swords will tear us apart again.
Frozen phoenix rise through the feeling
That inside of me awaits your healing.
I was never yours, you were never mine,
Though our souls forever intertwine.

Can you sense the seasons change
From the touch of my skin?
Do you feel the shiver beneath
From this winter within?

Now I grab this time to pass
... to the day
But you’ll return to me my love
And choose death as your way
