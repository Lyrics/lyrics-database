Outside you are flesh,
Ain’t perfect, so imperfect.
Could you ever see
A reflection in ...

Machine to this world,
Getting you I belived,
But by you I was deceived.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

Motion without erection,
Hole became an infection.
Exterminate me ...,
Place my mind to its rest.

You’ll be melted by the sun,
But god reminds you I’m the one.
Nothing to me,
Just cold machinery.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

In your hands I placed my heart,
You could see what you couldn’t feel.
This was my fatal error,
Loving something made from steel.

Made from steel.
