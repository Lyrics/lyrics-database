Are you serious?
What’s your angle?
You mangle my words!
When you asked me
I told you I’m sleeping
Just fine at night!
So why aren’t you?

I might lose my mind
If you won’t let it lie!
If I say I’m just fine,
I’m just fine!

Can you hear me?
I’m speaking to a wall
You built
Is it relevant
Only on your side?
Let it lie!

I might lose my mind
If you won’t let it lie!
If I say I’m just fine,
I’m just fine!

Can you see me?
Your eyes don’t believe me!
When you asked me
I told you I don’t know!
(Hear me, hear me)
I don’t know what went wrong!

I might lose my mind
If you won’t let it lie!
If I say I’m just fine,
I’m just fine!
