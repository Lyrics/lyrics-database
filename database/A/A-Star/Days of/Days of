What did you say, love?
What did you say, are we breaking?
You and I, didn’t think we…
Didn’t think we could shake it, but we might

At the right time
It’s the time of goodbye (goodbye)
If the motor runs it gets us through
The night

And we’re on, riding on
And we’re on to Avalon
And we meet to say “it’s over”
And we meet to say “it’s over”

Over (over, over, over, over…)

Did you think we…
Did you think we could shake it?
Right what we said is
What we said is we make it, wrong or right

... ... (...)
...
If you think we should stay here
I don’t mind (stay here), I don’t mind

And we’re on, riding on
And we’re on to Avalon
And we meet to say “it’s over”
And we meet to say “it’s over”

Over (over, over, over…)

And we’re on, riding on
And we’re on to Avalon
And we meet to say “it’s over”
And we meet to say “it’s over”

Over (over, over, over, over…)
