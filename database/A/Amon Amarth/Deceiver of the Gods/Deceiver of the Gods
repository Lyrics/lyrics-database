Since I was born, they have kept me down,
They have forced me to conform.
I will tear down the holy crown in a vengeful thunderstorm,
I loathe their bloody righteous ways
It fills me with despise,
Fueling flames of violent rage,
I will be their world's demise.

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods

All this rage, and all this hate,
It burns me deep inside,
And still it is, the only thing, keeping me alive.
Dark ambition within my heart and it's aching to break free
The one true nature of my soul, the giant lives in me.

Kneel!
You all shall kneel to me!
Or death will set you free!
You all shall kneel to me!

Fall!
You all shall fall to me!
Vengeance will be sweet!
You all shall fall to me!

Asgard's always been my home
But I'm of different blood
I will overthrow their throne
Deceiver of the gods

Asgard's always been my home
I'm of a different blood
I've come to overthrow their throne
Deceiver, deceiver of the gods!
