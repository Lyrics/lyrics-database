I was born of giant's blood
Raised in Asgård, the home of gods
I am the master of disguise
For this trait I've gained your prize

Fast in thought, quicker tongue
Brawl with me and you'll get stung
I am the master of deceit
My words bind or set you free

I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter

You call me evil; curse my name
But you only have yourselves to blame
Order need its anarchy
Balance through calamity

We mixed our blood in olden days
Now I wander like a stray
We were brothers, now estranged
I will have my sweet revenge

My words are poison to your ears
I say the words you fear
Still you know it is the truth you hear
Ragnarök is drawing near

There you sit in Aegir's hall
Waiting for the coming fall
Council of the now condemned
Twilight of both gods and men

Face the facts; you're old and weak
Empty words are all you speak
No escape, there's no return
The universe shall bleed and burn

I am the eagle in the sky
The shape shifter
Vicious wolf
Howling in the night
The shape shifter
I am the walker on the wind
The shape shifter
Two-faced words
And a lying grin
The shape shifter
I am the eagle in the sky
The vicious wolf
Howling in the night
I am the walker on the wind
Lying words,
With an honest grin
The shape shifter
