Is there somewhere I can hide
From the burning light in the sky
You would think I would be all right
Iâ€™m not right in my mind
Energy inside
Causing me to fry

All the sound, all the sound
All the sound, all the sound
(Turn it down)
All around, all around
All around, all around
(Turn it down)
In the starlight
I am all right

Never mind the stuff I said
Give me moonshine light instead
When I said I would be all right
I lied, yeah lied
Apollo made me cry
Almost let me die

All the sound, all the sound
All the sound, all the sound
(Turn it down)
All around, all around
All around, all around
(Turn it down)
In the starlight
I am all right
