You have made a quite unright misinterpretation
After all it looks a lot like undervaluation

And on any given Sunday
We will take you at the altar of we
Glory flowing over me

You delivered with a bite your miscalculation
To we all it looks a lot like undervaluation
We take delight in your error
It’s your error made you angry
Finding out you’re over

And on any given Sunday
We will take you at the altar of we
Glory flowing over me

We have chosen you to go by elimination
Though we wish that you would go by your own volition
We found our might in the strangers
It’s the strangers who were waiting
We’re staying with the strangers

And on any given Sunday
We will take you at the altar of we
Glory flowing over me
