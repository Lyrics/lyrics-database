As a beauty, I am not any star
There are others more handsome by far
But my face, I don’t mind it
I’m behind it
It’s the people in front who get the jar

And me, and you, and me, and you, and me, and you, and me…

In a picture I am not any idol
All the others they lie by the fire
But my skin, I’m inside it
I am binded
As a model, I don’t have much to bare

Your face…
It’s your face that I mind
It’s your face…
It’s your face that I mind
Superlunary…
(And I mind, I mind that I mind)
Superlunary…
(And I mind, I mind that I mind)

And me, and you, and me, and you, and me, and you, and me…

As a seer, I rely on my mind
All the others think they thrive on a rise
But my eyes, they are wisest
When I’m blinded
As a prophet I won’t show you your star

Your face…
Your face that I mind
Your face…
Your face that I mind
(And I mind, I mind that I mind)
(And I mind, I mind that I mind)
