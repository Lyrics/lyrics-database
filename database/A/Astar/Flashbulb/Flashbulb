Riddled with sighs
And the babble tells lies
And the babble tells lies
And the babble gives rise to confusion

Buddy, your eye
Is a window inside
Is a window in mind
And the window is mine to look through

(I remember you)
And the flashbulb clicks and the moment sticks
(Evidence of story)
Only phantoms float in your hallways

So I say so long
Seems you’re gone
And I said goodbye to the body of you
Say so long
Are you gone?

Funny disguise
Made a funny girl wise
Made her funny inside
Made her funny with wine ’cause she missed you

Other ones try
To pretend it’s fine
It’ll never be fine
And it’s never all right
Did I quit you?

(Did you even notice)
And the moment when the window clears
(I can see the picture)
And you’re not coming back to me

So I say so long
Seems you’re gone
And I said goodbye to the body of you
Say so long
Are you gone?
