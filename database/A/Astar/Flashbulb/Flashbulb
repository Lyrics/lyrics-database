... valentines lie ... lie ...
... withering sign ... withering line ... to look through you
(... by you)
And the flashbulb ...
(... story)
Only ... go in a hurry

So I stay so numb
Seems you’re gone
And I say goodbye to the party of you
Stay so numb
I’m gone

... ... ...
All the ones tried to pretend it’s fine ... never be ... with you
(Did you take a notice)
That the moment when the window clears
(I can see vocation)
And you’re not coming back to me

So I stay so numb
Seems you’re gone
And I say goodbye to the party of you
Stay so numb
I’m gone
