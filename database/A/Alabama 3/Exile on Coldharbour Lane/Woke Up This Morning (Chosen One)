I’m gonna take you down
Deep down to the frontline
(Deep down)

You woke up this mornin’, got yourself a gun
Your mama always said you’d be the chosen one
She said, “You’re one in a million, you got to burn to shine”
But you were born under a bad sign with blue moon in your eyes
When you woke up this mornin’ and all that love had gone
Your papa never told you about right and wrong
Hey but you’re, but you’re lookin’ good, baby
I believe that you’re feelin’ fine, shame about it
Born under a bad sign with blue moon in your eyes, so sing it now

Woke up this mornin’
You got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes
So sad
Goddamn
A goddamn shame about it
Woke up this mornin’
You got a blue moon
Got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah
(Woke up this mornin’)

I see ya, ya woke up this mornin’
The world turned upside down
Lord above, things ain’t been the same
Since the Blues walked into town
Hey but you’re, but you’re one in a million
’Cause you got that shotgun shine, shame about it
Born under a bad sign with blue moon in your eyes, yeah (yeah)

Woke up this mornin’
You got a blue moon (ah-ha)
Got a blue moon in your eyes
So sad
Goddamn
A goddamn shame about it
Woke up this mornin’
You got a blue moon (ah-ha)
Got a blue moon in your eyes, yeah
(Woke up this mornin’)
Yeah, I khow you, you just can’t help yourself, yeah
(Yeah, oh)
You just can’t help yourself, yeah
(You just can’t help yourself, yeah)
(Eh-hay, ho-ho-ho)
But I know the one who can
Mister D. Wayne Love

When you woke up this mornin’ everythin’ was gone
By half past ten your head was goin’ ding-dong
Ringin’ like a bell from your head down to your toes
Like some voice tryna tell ya there’s somethin’ you should know
Last night you was flyin’ but today you’re so low
Ain’t it times like these makes you wonder if you’ll ever know
The meanin’ of things as they appear to the others
Wives, husbands, mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers
Don’t you wish you didn’t function?
Don’t you wish you didn’t think
Beyond the next pay check and the next little drink?
Well, you do, so make up your mind to go on
’Cause when you woke up this mornin’, everythin’ you had was gone

Woke up this mornin’
(When you woke up this mornin’, ah-ha)
Woke up this mornin’ (ah-ha)
(Woke up this mornin’)
Woke up this mornin’
You wanna be my (ah-ha), you wanna be the chosen one
Yeah, you know it ’cause (ah-ha)
You just can’t help yourself, yeah (yeah)
Woke up this mornin’ (ah-ha)
(When you woke up this mornin’)
Woke up this mornin’ (ah-ha)
(Woke up this mornin’)
Woke up this mornin’ (ah-ha)
Got yourself a gun
(Woke up this mornin’)
Got yourself a gun (ah-ha)
Got yourself a gun
