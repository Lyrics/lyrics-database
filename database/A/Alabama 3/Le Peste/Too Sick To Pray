I’m in a lonely room
Hank Williams sings the Lovesick Blues
Winter’s walkin’ up the avenue
I ain’t seen the sunshine since the 6th of June
But I tell you this

Don’t call the doctor, I’m gonna get better
Don’t run for the priest, I’m gonna find some faith
Just because I burned my Bible, baby
It don’t mean I’m too sick to pray

I’m in a crowded place, yea
But I can’t recognize a single face
And they say the thrill is in the chase
Well, I ain’t got the legs
I ain’t got the legs to run that race
But I tell you this

Don’t call the doctor, I’m gonna get better, yea
Don’t run for the priest, I’m gonna find some faith (faith, faith)
Just because I burned my Bible, baby
It don’t mean I’m too sick to pray

Better burn a candle bright
(Raise up some ghosts tonight)

They say I made my money messing up young minds
I stooped the congregation and left them all crying
In the rain, yeah, left them with their pain
Exit your boy with his ill-gotten gains
Well the blood runs deep and the blood runs cold
As the knife slits so another sucker is born
Thrown into this world alone
Doctor came knocking, wasn’t nobody home

Ease the pain

Don’t call the doctor, I’m gonna get better, yea
Don’t run for the priest, I’m gonna find some faith
Just because I burned my Bible, baby
It don’t mean I’m too sick to pray

Don’t call the doctor, I’m gonna get better, yea
Don’t run for the priest, I’m gonna find some faith (faith, faith)
Just because I burned my Bible, baby
It don’t mean, it don’t mean I’m too sick to pray

(Ease the pain)
I’m too sick to pray
(Ease the pain)
I’m too sick to pray
(Ease the pain)
I’m too sick to pray
It don’t mean…
