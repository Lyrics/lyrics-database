It’s just another day
Million people choosing their ways
I like to get it out
Cyber thoughts — heavy gray clouds

Ready for the trip
A trip — near to the rim
A higgs must be broken
Discover the unspoken

And what if I could find you
Space and gravity behind these clouds?
And what if you would tell me
It’s internally and close around?

And what if I could find you
Space and gravity behind these clouds?
And what if you would tell me
It’s internally and close around?

(Metro boy)
(Metro boy)

(Metro boy)

It’s just another day
Million people choosing their ways
I like to get it out
Cyber thoughts — heavy gray clouds

Ready for the trip
A trip — near to the rim
A higgs must be broken
Discover the unspoken

And what if I could find you
Space and gravity behind these clouds?
And what if you would tell me
It’s internally and close around?

And what if I could find you
Space and gravity behind these clouds?
And what if you would tell me
It’s internally and close around?

(Metro boy)
