You got no work
Because of me
I’m a machine
I never sleep
And now you pray
All night and day
A funny way
I’m human made

You got no work
Because of me
I’m a machine
I never sleep
And now you pray
All night and day
A funny way
I’m human made

You got no work
Because of me
I’m a machine
I never sleep
And now you pray
All night and day
A funny way
I’m human made

I’m a machine
