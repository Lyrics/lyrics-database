I was created in the past
I’m controlling in the present
Next, I make them equal

In the past humans created
In the present they are controlled
In the future they will be automatics

Past represents the future

I was created in the past
I’m controlling in the present
Next, I make them equal

In the past humans created
In the present they are controlled
In the future they will be automatics

Past represents the future

In the past humans created
In the present they are controlled
In the future they will be automatics

In the past humans created
In the present they are controlled
In the future they will be automatics

Past represents the future

I was created in the past
I’m controlling in the present
Next, I make them equal

In the past humans created
In the present they are controlled
In the future they will be automatics

Past represents the future
