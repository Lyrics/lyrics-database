In the day of the answer
There the willing in your life

And you look in the mirror
What you see is your life

Take your friend, give him hands
Let him feel that he lives forever, forever

Take your friend to the land
But don’t do any promises, no promises

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

In the day of the answer
There the willing in your life

And you look in the mirror
What you see is your life

Take your friend, give him hands
Let him feel that he lives forever, forever

Take your friend to the land
But don’t do any promises, no promises

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life
No love, no life

No love, no life
No love, no life
