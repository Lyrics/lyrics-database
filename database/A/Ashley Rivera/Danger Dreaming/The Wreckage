Choking on a life when I started to cry
You turn your head, wouldn’t catch my eye
And I don’t know why
I can’t let you go

’Cause nothing ever keeps you satisfied
I see the clouds turn black outside
And there’ll be nothing left of me
When your wind blows

’Cause this is stormy weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after the ruin and the waste
It’s a natural disaster, a crying shame
You keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
And I’m left standing in the wreckage of you

I heard the sirens, covered my ears
Made believe these were happy tears
Oh, if only I could
Hear the warning

You left away when you left me last
It’s my mistake to keep coming back
And I don’t wanna think about
What this will look like in the morning

’Cause this is stormy weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after the ruin and the waste
It’s a natural disaster, a crying shame
You keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
And I’m left standing in the wreckage of you

Take cover, there’s a storm rolling in
Circle spinning round in a howling wind
Glass is gonna break
Trees are gonna bend
Take cover, there’s a storm rolling in
Take cover, take cover, take cover

’Cause this is stormy weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after, the ruin and the waste
It’s a natural disaster, a crying shame
Oh, you keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
You keep doing what you do, what you do
When you know I’ll be
Right here standing
In the wreckage of you

Take cover
Take cover
