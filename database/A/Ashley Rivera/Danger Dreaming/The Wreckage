Chokin’ on a laugh when I started to cry
You turned your head, wouldn’t catch my eye
And I don’t know why
I can’t let you go

’Cause nothing ever keeps you satisfied
I see the clouds turn black outside
And there’ll be nothing left of me
When your wind blows

’Cause this is stormy weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after the rolling waves
It’s a natural disaster, a cryin’ shame
You keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
And I’m left standing in the wreckage of you

I heard the sirens, covered my ears
Made believe these were happy tears
Oh, if only I could
Heed the warning

You left a wake when you left me last
It’s my mistake to keep coming back
And I don’t want to think about
What this will look like in the morning

’Cause this is stormy weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after the rolling waves
It’s a natural disaster, a cryin’ shame
You keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
And I’m left standing in the wreckage of you

Take cover, there’s a storm rollin’ in
Circles spinnin’ round in a howlin’ wind
Glass is gonna break, trees are gonna bend
Take cover, there’s a storm rollin’ in
Take cover, take cover, take cover

’Cause this is deadly weather, a hurricane
Nothing left after, the rolling waves
It’s a natural disaster, a cryin’ shame
Oh, you keep doing what you do, what you do
’Til you’re through with me
You keep doing what you do, what you do
When you know I’ll be
Right here standing in the wreckage of you

Take cover
Take cover
