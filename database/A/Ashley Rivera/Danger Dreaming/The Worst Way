Your eyes are embers
Burn me alive
I’m coming closer
Into the fire

I
Let my secrets out to play
I
Want you in the worst way

This ice is dangerous
To the life I had
I’m only Icarus
Melting wings

I
Let my secrets out to play
I
Want you in the worst way

Bring me down like you do
Who am I apart from you?
My world fallen at your feet
Watch you make a flower bleed

I
Let my secrets out to play
I
Want you in the worst way

I
Let my secrets slip away
I
Want you in the worst way (worst way, worst way)
