I want to share your mouthful
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet

You're the first and last of your kind
(Pull me like an animal out of a hole!)
I wanna be every lever you pull
And all showers that shower you

I'm gonna paw, paw at you
Like a cat paws at my woolen jumper
Be your minpin and borrower of handsome trivia

Devour me
Lou, Lou, let the cover girls sing!

All handclaps, you will clap
(Let me be the wallpaper that papers up your room)
I wanna be every button you press
And all the baths that surround you
Yes I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around saw dusted patios
I'm gonna kiss you, like the sun browns you

Devour me
Devour me
If you really think that you can stomach me

I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle
I want every other freckle, freckle
