When the skies, were opened up…
Your mouth had said enough…
And the silence became something from a fairytale

When the lies, were building up…
Your kiss was just enough…
And the violence came to us in great detail

It came for me,
In misery,
Now I am face down,
Staring at the ground.

It came for me,
In misery,
Now I am face down,
Staring at the ground.

Our emotions, from above
Became heavy love
Giving us these words of satisfaction

And these actions, push and shove,
In these euphoric handcuffs
Bringing forth a life, with retribution

It came for me,
In misery,
Now I am face down,
Staring at the ground.
