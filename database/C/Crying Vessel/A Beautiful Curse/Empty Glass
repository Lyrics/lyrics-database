Empty your glass
It’s time to make love last, come on
Keeping your faith
Something to make you safe
Come on (come on)

Hold yourself
Save yourself
From harm
Hold yourself
Save yourself
From harm
Until you rise above
This thing that we call love

Flying away
All you feel is pain that stays, come on
Trying to play
A game of love or hate
Come on (come on)

Hold yourself
Save yourself
From harm
Hold yourself
Save yourself
From harm
Until you rise above
This thing that we call love
