Time…
Time without you
Makes me wonder
What comes next
Find…
Something about you
Makes me hallow
In my head

Blind…
Blind without you
Makes me wallow
In this curse
My…
Real life virtue
Makes me swallow
All my words

Unlike you I just want more
Pushing you right out the door
Go ahead and seize the day
Watch our life start to decay

Take my hand, I’m left for dead (Take my hand, I’m left for dead)
Keep forgetting what you said (Keep forgetting what you said)
Ask for life with deep regret (Ask for life with deep regret)
Ghostly figures are in my head…
They’re in my head
They’re in my head
They’re in my head
They’re in my head
You’re in my head
