Her scent is like poetry
(Undone… unheard)
Come down before she screams
(Undone… your word)

Let me sink too deep
Losing the world around me
I can’t come back now
I’m too far gone, I’m drowning

Be still, my love, behave
(Undone… unheard)
Our love comes back from the grave
(Undone… your word)

Let me sink too deep
Losing the world around me
I can’t come back now
I’m too far gone, I’m drowning
I’m peeling back my skin
I’m making my eyes sore
Bring me to myself
And then we close the door
