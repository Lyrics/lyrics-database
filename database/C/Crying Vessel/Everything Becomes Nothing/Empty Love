I’m trying to forget
That everything we meant was nothing
Holding onto things
I always thought we could be more than something

But the way you threw away my heart
Tore my soul apart
I can figure out that you just need
Empty love

I’m trying to forget
That everything we meant was nothing
Holding onto things
I always thought we could be more than something

But the way you threw away my heart
Tore my soul apart
I can figure out that you just need
Empty love
