Feels like I’m stepping now
From the shadows into the river

You look at me, that kind of stare
The one like you care
I am broken down
And nowhere to be found

We can turn this around
We can turn this around
We can turn this around

So lift up curtian
And let me see
I’m on my knees
You know that it’s meant to be

Just lift up curtain
And let me bleed
We can agree
To act like it’s meant to be

Seems so certain
Based on my assumptions
So let me breathe
Let your heart run free

You look at me, you have that fear
The one that I feel
I’m broken down
And nowhere to be found

We can turn this around
We can turn this around
We can turn this around
We can turn this around
