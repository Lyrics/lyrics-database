You’re floating dead boy
With nothing to destroy
...

You’re floating dead boy
With nothing left to destroy
Now that ...
Only friend that you know

That you know

You were never meant, meant to survive this
You were never meant, meant to survive this
You were never meant, meant to survive this
You were never meant, meant to survive

You’re floating dead boy
With nothing left to destroy
Just ... water in your lungs
... the ones you loved
You’re floating dead boy
With nothing left to destroy
Now the darkness deep below
Is the only friend that you know

Demons come out to play when you’re around
Through clouds of thick smoke
We’re going down

You were never meant, meant to survive this
We’re going down
You were never meant, meant to survive this
We are going down
You were never meant, meant to survive this
We’re going down
You were never meant, meant to survive
We are going down

We all going down
