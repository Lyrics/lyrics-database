I cease to exist inside your essence
It hurts so desperately
So all this time means nothing
I’m so sorry, you’re lost to me

I’m confused how this could’ve happened
I’m confused how you could be
So hardly, so selfish
Don’t do this

Your boat
Seems so far away
Your boat
Seems so far away

I can’t make you see
What you’ve meant to me
I can’t make you see
I can’t

I can’t make you see
What you’ve done to me
I can’t make you see
But I swear

I can’t forget, I tried do more
I can’t forget, I can’t ignore

(So cold, so cold)
(So cold, so cold)

I can’t make you see
What you’ve meant to me
I can’t make you see
I can’t

I can’t make you see
What you’ve done to me
I can’t make you see
But I swear
