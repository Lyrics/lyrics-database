It’s like a blind-sided cannon
Was aiming at me
Just looking for an outcome
That you never can see

I’m losing my sight
While ...
You need your space
You need more time
You need more time

All you do is accuse me
Are you using me?
I can tell you are not
I’m giving my heart
To the girl of my dreams

All you do is accuse me
Are you using me?
I can tell you are not
I’m giving my heart
To the girl of my dreams

I don’t need your handouts
I’m deep in the debris
Was looking for the sanctum
While using your greed
