As I gaze into your eyes
I see a fluorescent wound
It’s high-noon-covered in gloom
Giving me forgive this far too soon

You talk with resonance
It sounds so innocent
I can’t help it, I fall for you
You’ve shown me the blood red moon

As I gaze into your eyes
I see a fluorescent wound
It’s high-noon-covered in gloom
Giving me forgive this far too soon

You talk with resonance
It sounds so innocent
I can’t help it, I fall for you
You’ve shown me the blood red moon
