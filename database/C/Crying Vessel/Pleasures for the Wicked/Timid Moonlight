The sun is down
I’m yours to keep
Now’s your chance
The hole runs deep

So not too fast
Go ahead and take me
And let’s dance
The night away
Until the break of day

The frosted grounds
Are ours to keep
Wake me up
Eternal sleep

Let’s make it last
Go ahead and take me
And let’s dance
The night away
Until the break of day

Can you see?
I’m closing the door
To our dreams
So take it from me
I’m a broken man
And not what I seem
It’s falling from the heavens above

I can’t speak
I’m already hung
I fell too fast
Back in love

And when the sun wakes
We lose our sight
It’s meant to be
Timid moonlights

Can you see?
I’m closing the door
To our dreams
So take it from me
I’m a broken man
And not what I seem
It’s falling from the heavens above

It’s what you’ve done for me
I know it’s hard
But it’s what we need
It’s falling from the heavens above
