The light has come
To take me
(I think that I’m floating)
Don’t know where I’m going
Or what I’ll see
(The darkness is growing)

I can’t complain
My time is done
I’ve done the best that I can
But Death has won

What has happened?
Why can’t I find my wings?
Why does it feel so wrong?
With your tears on my face
I think I’m losing faith

Please don’t be sad
Or hate me
(I can’t keep holding)
It’s so damn cold
I can’t breathe
(I feel like I’m choking)

I won’t complain
Even though it’s tough
But these wounds will heal
When I look from above

What has happened?
Why can’t I find my wings?
Why does it feel so wrong?
With your tears on my face
I think I’m losing grip
Of what helps me survive
If these are my last words
I think I’m buried alive
I’m being buried alive
