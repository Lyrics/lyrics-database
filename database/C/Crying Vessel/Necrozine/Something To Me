Welcome to your body
Put yours close to mine
A big denial to push us back in line
Creep into your thighs and your light pale skin
Another rampage lost at a late night inn
Animal instincts prey on our minds
I’ll pull you closer until you are mine
Seeping through the facts with our distant heat
Always give it all when beneath the sheets

Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell

You’re something else
You’re something to me
You’re something else
You’re something to me

Grab our bats
Your blissful needs
Lose your fears, show up defeat
Just say the word and I’ll make you mine
Nothings right unless you’re feeling fine
Jump to the moon, show me the sun
Step into my room where the heads are hung
Creeping inner thoughts don’t forget the chase
It always feels better when you’re red in the face

Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell
Something else in my inner cell

You’re something else
You’re something to me
You’re something else
You’re something to me

You’re something to me

You’re something to me
You’re something to me
You’re something to me
You’re something to me
