She looks like him
As she starts to swim
You can keep on crawling
Back again

As you push it in
’Til you push it in

She looks like him
As she starts to swim
You can keep on crawling
Back again

It’s been done before
As you hit the floor
So just keep on smiling
As you push it in

’Til you push it in
’Til you push it in
’Til you push it in
’Til you push it in
