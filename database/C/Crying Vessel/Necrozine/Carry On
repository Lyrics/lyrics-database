Go on now
Let’s get it out of the way
Your actions won’t
Hurt me again
I missed my chance
To tell you how I felt
So I better just carry on

(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)

I see it now
Your words paved the way
The angel of dust
And the light of day
I missed my chance
To bring you back again
So I better just carry on

(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
(Just carry on, carry on)
