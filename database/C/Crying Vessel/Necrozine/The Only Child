[You bring delivery]

You wear this bashful shame
Like it’s underneath
And these tedious pains
Should never come clean
It seems like you’re the one
Very well rehearsed
Throwing out the lines
That were never deserved

Like an angel
With darkened wings
Like a child with hunger and needs
We are sorry this happened to you
But you’ll get through
You’ll get right through

You wear this bashful shame
Like it’s underneath
And these tedious pains
Should never come clean
It seems like you’re the one
Very well rehearsed
Throwing out the lines
That were never deserved

Like an angel
With darkened wings
Like a child with hunger and needs
We are sorry this happened to you
But you’ll get through
You’ll get right through
