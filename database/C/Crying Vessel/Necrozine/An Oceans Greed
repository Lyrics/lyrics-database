It means everything
Life’s true symphony
My future’s case
Saints can’t resist

Crashing waves at shore
I couldn’t have asked for more
You are my everything
Not a second’s missed

I finally found my personal poet
I will part the oceans to make you mine
We will skip forward, this time we’ll show it
Nothing’s coming between you and I

A true lover’s hold
Come right back to me
These past 3 days
What can I forget?

Spin around ceiling fans
Give me a late night call
You are my everything
And not a second’s missed

Not a second’s missed

I finally found my personal poet
I will part the oceans to make you mine
We will skip forward, this time we’ll show it
Nothing’s coming between you and I

Between you and I
