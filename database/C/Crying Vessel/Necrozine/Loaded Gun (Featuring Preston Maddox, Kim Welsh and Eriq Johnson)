(A loaded gun)
(Pointed at you)
(Through the window)
(Pointed at you)

(A loaded gun)
(Pointed at you)
(Through the window)
(Pointed at you)

Listen what is in my heart
Listen, you will blow my mind
Shoot the arrow at my heart
Holding, running out of time

You look the other way
You look the other way
You look the other way
You look the other way

(A loaded gun)
(Pointed at you)
(Through the window)
(Pointed at you)

(A loaded gun)
(Pointed at you)
(Through the window)
(Pointed at you)

You look the other way
You look the other way
You look the other way
You look the other way
