You said you’re God’s gift to man
Though I beg to differ, if I can
Move to the music for me
It will always feel better on the other side

On the other side
When you take my hand

You act as if you know me
Then my heart surrenders with you at my side
Taking these stabs at true taste
It is always much greener on the other side

On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
On the other side
When you take my hand

On the other side
On the other side
When you take my hand
