I can’t believe I saw her
Standing in the doorway, watching me
It’s as if I shot her
Told her this life was killing me
All she does is praise herself
Acts as if there’s no one else around
Nothing but a selfish pie
Driving reckless, bending the time

(Watching you
What we gonna do?
Watching you
Until you do
What you wanna do?
I won’t let you
Take the time with you
Calmly
I’ll be watching you)

Driving reckless, bending the time

(Watching you
What we gonna do?
Watching you

Calmly

(I won’t let you
Take the time with you
Calmly
I’ll be watching you)
