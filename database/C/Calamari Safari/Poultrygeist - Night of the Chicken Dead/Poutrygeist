You’re sitting at home and your stomach is bubbling.
No food in the fridge and your hunger is growing.
(Ooo-ooo-ooo, what to do?)
You hop in your car and drive straight to get drive-through.
Murder with fries is described as fast food.
(Ooo-ooo-ooo, la-la-la-la-la) You better run!

’Cause this is Poultrygeist, when the blood keeps spilling.
This is Poultrygeist, where there’s lots of killing.
You’ll be eaten alive by zombie chickens tonight.
You’re all gonna die!

How would you like to be baked and broiled?
Thrown in a pan to be fried in some oil?
(Ooo-ooo-ooo, what to do?)

You swallow it down with a smile on your face.
Little did you know there’s a curse on this place.
(Ooo-ooo-ooo, la-la-la-la-la) You better run!

’Cause this is Poultrygeist, when the blood keeps spilling.
This is Poultrygeist, where there’s lots of killing.
You’ll be eaten alive by zombie chickens tonight.
You’re all gonna die!

You’ll be eaten alive by zombie chickens tonight.
You’re all gonna die!

So think twice, about where you eat.
Think twice, about eating meat.
Don’t kill, little baby chickens
Be nice, and try to find a brand new solution.
Zombie chicken retribution.

Poultrygeist!
You’re all gonna die!

Poultrygeist, when the blood keeps spilling.
This is Poultrygeist, where there’s lots of killing.
You’ll be eaten alive by zombie chickens tonight.
You’re all gonna die!

You’re all gonna die!
You’re all gonna die!
Woooooo-oooh!
You’re all gonna die!
