It’s nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you’re going
It’s nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you’re going

Sorry for these bitter words
But I’m in no mood to pretend
Why should I bother with you
When you’re not even a good friend

I’m the tosser for thinking
It was anything more than it was
But you’re the loser
Yes you’re the loser
You think you’re above god
And beyond reach
Beyond reach
Beyond reach
Beyond reach

It’s nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you’re going

Never pick a fight with someone bigger than you
That’s what I learnt when I was at school
And it doesn’t really matter
How clever you think you are
Those years, they leave
All kinds of scars

It’s nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you’re going
It’s nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you’re going

Carry on as you always have
And you will get
Your just reward
It may not be what you expected
But then there’s nothing
You can’t afford

Oh, I’m the joker for dreaming
That it could get much worse than this
But you’re the loser
Yes you’re the loser
You think you’re above god
And beyond reach
Beyond reach
Beyond reach
Beyond reach
