Grow out of your obsessions
You think you’re bad
But I’m badder than you
’Cause mine has come through consideration
While your reaction is nothing new
So go on genius, be who you are
You’re so flat and one dimensional

If you go my way you won’t go wrong
You’ll find out where you really belong
If you search it out it will make you strong
Then you’ll go on and on, and on, and on, and on

You want what’s mine
But you don’t deserve it
One tenth is all you can have
Why care why share
Stamp your feet ’cause life’s unfair
Why share why care
Stamp your feet ’cause life’s unfair

If you go my way you won’t go wrong
You’ll find out where you really belong
If you search it out it will make you strong
Then you’ll go on and on, and on, and on, and on

On and on, and on
On and on, and on, and on

You have to watch for the smallest details
Just to stop
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
The alligator from getting up
