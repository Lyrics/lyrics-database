You can take my advice
But don’t you think twice
About leaving me

Even though you shouldn’t know
I can’t help but tell you so
Easily

If my faith fails
Will life prevail?
Will life prevail?

We’re signals and alibis
We’re half-truth and half-lies
We’re signals and alibis
We nearly laugh and nearly cry

I only want to be liked by you
I only want to be liked by you

You’re the one who has it all
but don’t pretend you didn’t fall
frequently

So when you go I hope you know
I saw it all and let you go
lazily

Now my heart’s frail
Will you prevail?
Will you prevail?

We’re signals and alibis
We’re half-truth and half-lies
We’re signals and alibis
We nearly laugh and nearly cry

I only want to be liked by you
I only want to be liked by you

We’re signals and alibis
We’re half-truth and half-lies
We’re signals and alibis
We nearly laugh and nearly cry

I only want to be liked by you
I only want to be liked by you

Alibi
It has it all
La la la la la la

Alibi
It has it all
La la la la la la

Take,
Take my advice

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la

La la la la la la
La la la la la la la
