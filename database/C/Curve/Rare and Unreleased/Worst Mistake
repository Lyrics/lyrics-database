She said, “I dreamt of talking in clicks”
And what I was saying wouldn’t clear with anyone else here
’Cause I’m waiting for my life to arrive
I’m sick and tired of trying to survive (to survive, to survive)

And this is real
I’m not alone, no fear

Better be careful, it might come true
You always think they’re in front of you
Better be cautious, don’t be fake
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make

She said, “I’ve waited for this time on my own”
Back to clicks, can I handle it?
Can I fathom it, or understand it?
Connected here

My little tear
It’s merely mine right here

Better be careful, it might come true
You always think they’re in front of you
Better be cautious, don’t be fake
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make

Believe it’s real
I’m not alone, I’m not alone

Better be careful, it might come true
Your worst nightmare in front of you
Better be cautious, don’t be fake
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make

Better be careful, it might come true
Your worst nightmare in front of you
Better be cautious, don’t be fake
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make
That’s the worst mistake you could make
