I get confused ’cause I think you care
But in this life, nothing is fair
You twist my arm to suit yourself
You wear Prada to show your wealth

You’re sad and lonely, you stay unloved
But there’s no hope for the great and the good
You don’t do nothing ’cause you know you should
You get confused ’cause you think you’re God

Always lying to save your face
I see your shame, I see disgrace
If you could only tell the truth
You’d have a better sense of you

When you show it, everything is lost
Before you know it, everyone has gone
To a different party on another weekend
To a different party with brand new friends

I only hope you get the time to change
But there’s no winners in this firing range
You play a game you can’t ever win
’Cause no one cares where you’ve been

You make mistakes like everyone else
But don’t move on, stay on the shelf
You cry your tears alone at night
And wake up cold in the morning light

You wake up cold…
You wake up cold in the morning light

When you show it, everything is lost
Before you know it, everyone has gone
To a different party on another weekend
To a different party with brand new friends

I get confused ’cause I think you care
But in this life, nothing is fair
You twist my arm to suit yourself
You wear Prada to show your wealth

Sad and lonely, you stay unloved
But there’s no hope for the great and the good
You don’t do nothing ’cause you know you should
You get confused ’cause you think you’re God

When you show it, everything is lost
Before you know it, everyone has gone
To a different party on another weekend
To a different party with brand new friends
