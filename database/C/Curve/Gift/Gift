I always thought I knew what you were like,
Had no idea that we would ever fight.
As long as I could keep you in my sights,
You’d only glow and give off light.

I don’t envy anything I’ve seen,
It’s not a contest with you against me.
I only want you to let it out,
So come on baby put it about.

’Cause I need you to be,
I want you to feel free.

It’s the gift that you’re given,
It’s the hand that you’re dealt,
It’s the gift that you’re given,
And I’m the one to show it to you babe,
The one to show it to you babe.

How I long to take you in my arms,
And be a friend with style and charm,
I hope I make it for your sake and mine,
The way it stands there isn’t the time.

’Cause I need you to be,
Want you to see me.

It’s the gift that you’re given,
It’s the hand that you’re dealt,
It’s the gift that you’re given,
And I’m the one to show it to you babe.

It’s the gift that you’re given,
It’s the hand that you’re dealt,
It’s the gift that you’re given,
And I’m the one to show it to you babe,
The one to show it to you babe.

Do it to please me
Do it to please me
Do it to please me
Do it to please me

’Cause I need you to be,
I want you, want you

It’s the gift that you’re given,
It’s the hand that you’re dealt,
It’s the gift that you’re given,
And I’m the one to show it to you.

It’s the gift that you’re given,
It’s the hand that you’re dealt,
It’s the gift that you’re given,
And I’m the one to show it to you babe,
The one to show it to you babe.

I want you,
I want you.
I’m the one to show it to you babe,
I’m the one to show it to you babe.

I want you,
I want you.
I’m the one to show it to you babe,
I’m the one to show it to you babe.
