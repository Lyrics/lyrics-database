Silence waits till it no longer
Knows right from wrong

It’s reaching out
It’s reaching out
It’s reaching out

Bursting through
It is softly spoken

It’s staying young
Staying young
Staying young
Staying young

Before we get to love
Before we get to romance
Before we’ve had enough
Just give it one more chance

Give it one more chance

Hung up on romance
Hung up on romance

Grieve in love
Before it’s over
Dead by design

It’s reaching out
It’s reaching out
It’s reaching out

Before we get to love
Before we get to romance
Before we’ve had enough
Just give it one more chance

(Give it one more chance)
Give it one more chance

Hung up on romance
Hung up on romance

Hey you know
I don’t do so well

I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know

Cos I’m hung up
Hung up
Hung up
Hung up
Can’t you tell?

I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know

Hey you know
I don’t do so bad

I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know
I’d love to know

Before we get to love
Before we get to romance
Before we’ve had enough
Just give it one more chance

Just give it one more chance

Hung up on romance
Hung up on romance

Hung up on romance
Hung up on romance

Hung up on romance
Hung up on romance
