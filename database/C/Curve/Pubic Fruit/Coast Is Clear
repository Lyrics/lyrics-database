Above my bed
In this ugly room
Hangs the whisper
Of the same man

You could be my father
For the love we’ve shown
It’s just a little too late
It’s never enough to swallow those pills
Now I’m sick, and always will be

Take it, I don’t want it
You can have what you like
Just don’t try to trick me to sleep
Don’t turn out those lights

You could be my father
For the love we’ve shown
It’s just a little too late
It’s never enough to swallow those pills
Now I’m sick, and always will be

Dreams of meeting truth
Be my father
Dreams of meeting truth
For the love

I said
You could be my father
For the love that we’ve shown
It’s just a little too late
It’s never enough to swallow those pills
Now I’m sick, now I’m sick, now I’m sick

Just when you thought it was alright
Just when you thought it was alright

Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
