You better believe it (hey yeah)
You better believe it (hey yeah)
You better believe it (hey yeah)
You better believe it (hey yeah)

In a conversation, talking of nothing
We were drinking sweet wine comforting our one and only
In our sterile business we have become jealous
Satisfied with our desolation, wrapped in our vivid dreams
Now I remember two days that mean a lot to me
I remember the two days where every hour was a day
And every minute was a lifetime and the ocean was a sea
And you dragged me into the mountains on a flimsy guarantee

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?
I’ve given you everything
I’ve given you nothing

I used to think of angels but that’s all gone
I used to dream of love and kisses wanting to belong
And I tear around the corners blindfolded to the world
I used to think that candyfloss was only made for girls

See how it feels for me?
Do you believe in me?

Hard-headed sense of failure in a narrow mind
I never used to think about the hurt I’d left behind
And now it falls upon me like winter snow
And I turn the same corners when there’s no place left to go

The stronger the man the stronger the woman
If it ended now would you be willing?

Do you believe in me?
(This is my own private hour)
(This is my own private hour)
See how it feels for me?

Could you love me?
Could you love me?
Could you love me?
Could you love me?

(Could?)

Could you love me?
Could you love me?
Could you love me?
Could you love me?

(Could you love me?)

Could you love me?
Could you love me?

(Could)

Could you love me?
Could you love me?

(you love me?)

(Could you love me?)

(Could you love me?)
