On the days we get together
We talk in volumes
And drink some coffee
Cook the numbers, clear our minds
Forget our worries
There untrue and unkind

There's no truth, it's instinct
There's no lies, that's gone too
There's no truth, it's instinct
There's no lies, that's gone too

All he says
Causes scandal
I've heard it said that he's the original
Verbal vandal
Who steals your words,
Clears out your mind

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure
There's no way I'll get sucked in
There's no way, that's damn sure

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure

Hopelessly reaching

There's no truth
There's no lies

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure

There's no way you'll convert me
There's no way, that's for sure

There's no truth
There's no lies
