She’s had a psychotic dream
For the last ten days
She feels as if she’s sinking
In and out, in and out, in and out of phase

Che comes up for air
She thinks she’s a queen
Starts telling all the choirboys
Where she’s been

She dresses in black
Only for the occasion
She thinks she’s a negro
But she’s only caucasian

She can’t tune in
She can’t tune in
She can’t get off that bus
She can’t get off that bus
She can’t grab hold
She can’t grab hold
She’s a mess this girl
And it’s time you were told

It’s like watching my own dream
This is not what it seems
So calculated
Now that’s infiltrated

In the harshness of daylight
I’m frightened by sunlight
But I know those night-eyes
Will keep me from harm

She can’t tune in
She can’t tune in
She can’t get off that bus
She can’t get off that bus
She can’t grab hold
She can’t grab hold
She’s a mess this girl
And it’s time…

Keep on keeping me from harm
Keep on keeping me from harm
Keep on keeping me from harm
Keep on keeping me from harm

Keep on keeping me from harm
Keep on keeping me from harm

Keep on keeping me from harm
Keep on keeping me from harm
