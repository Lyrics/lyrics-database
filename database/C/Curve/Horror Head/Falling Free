You never know
How to make the choice
To be a winner
You make a miracle voice
On the top floor
Turning off the faxes

I think I live in this one
I think I live in this one

Pick up the paper and file it somewhere
My mood is unreal

You’re near me
You will catch me
And believe me
you will catch my falling heart

The sun will be shining
Through the window
When my mood is unreal
My mood is unreal

You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry

I think I live in this one
I think I live in this one

I pick up the paper and file it somewhere

The sun will be shining
Through the window
When my mood is unreal
My mood is unreal

You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry
You told me you wouldn’t cry
