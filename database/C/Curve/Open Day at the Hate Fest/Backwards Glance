With a backwards glance I said goodbye
Saw the regret in your eyes
It’s too late now to change the truth
While we’re living under the same roof

It’s a ruse of yours
To alter perception,
Manipulate a violent situation
For your own gain

With my tits in the air
I’m strong and proud
You’ll see me laughing out loud
On a crowded street
In the summer heat
We’ll all be there
So come and share

It’s a ruse of yours
To alter perception,
Manipulate a vital situation
To your own gain
And your own needs
And your own fear
And your own tears

Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey

With a backwards glance I said goodbye
Saw the regret in your eyes
It’s too late now to change the truth
While we’re living under the same roof

It’s a ruse of yours
To spoil perfection,
Manipulate a violent situation
For your own gain
And your own needs
And your own fear
And your own tears

Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
Seek and destroy, smile and obey
