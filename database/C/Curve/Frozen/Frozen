In my eyes you smile like an angel
Blessed with love, invest in life
But in my heart you sound like a traitor
Blessed with sin, invest in life

In my heart and in my soul
Everywhere I go
You are with me
I can feel you everywhere
A certain something in the air
You are with me, you are with me

In your way you cry like a baby
Blessed with shame, invest in life
In the garden I will grow
A hanging tree for all to know
You are with me, invest in life

In my heart and in my soul
Everywhere I go
You are with me
I can feel you everywhere
A certain something in the air
You are with me

In my heart and in my soul
Everywhere I go
You are with me

I can feel you everywhere
A certain something in the air
You are with me

You know that man next door, is getting on my nerves
He’s so rich in his low down politics
You know his wife?
She’s such a pretty thing
