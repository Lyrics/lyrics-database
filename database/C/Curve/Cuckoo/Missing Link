I had a heart but I buried it someplace
I had a brain but my body won the race
I dream in pictures, pictures of you
A figure of eight just won’t do

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

You picked the fruit that gave you a sweet taste
You walk the tightrope unwilling to see straight
You pick me up, then you pull me down
Made up your mind that I’m the clown

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked too much

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

You had a dream and you thought it religious
You had a taste and it made it contagious
It rips you up, then it spits you out
Makes you know what it’s all about

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we walked away too fast
Accidentally we took too much

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we talked about the past
Accidentally we took too much

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Was there tragedy, all we did?
Now I know there’s no place for it

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Was it magic that redefined
The missing link to blow your mind?

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Was there tragedy in the things we did?
Now I know there’s no place for it

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
