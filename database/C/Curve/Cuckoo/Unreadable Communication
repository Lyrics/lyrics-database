When you hear the way the others talk
It makes you wonder what they bothered for
When you see the way opinion swings
It makes you strive, strive, strive for greater things

I wasn’t born to be good enough for you
I am here to be nobody’s fool
When you see the way that loose lips talk
It makes you cry, cry, cry for it all to stop

I would like to invite you
To my mother’s house
To my bedroom
To play those old records
We know all the words to
And I would like you to kiss me
To crush me, to lick me
’Til I beg you to stop
’Til you drive me crazy
’Til I want you to stop
’Til you drive me crazy
’Til I beg you to stop
’Til you drive me crazy

That’s all it takes
A subtle movement
That’s all it takes
To make the program

When you hear the way the loose lips talk
It makes you wonder what you bothered for
When you see the way opinion swings
It makes you strive, strive, strive for greater things

That’s all it takes
A subtle movement
That’s all it takes
To make the program

A subtle movement
To make the program

A subtle movement
To make the program

A subtle movement
To make the program

A subtle movement
To make the program

A subtle movement
To make the program
