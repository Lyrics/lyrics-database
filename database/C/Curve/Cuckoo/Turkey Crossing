All my friends are English
I heard you say that
And you stand beyond reproach

With everything considered
You don’t think you’ve done badly
For yourself

You should consider it an honor

I’m finished with you
Please be finished with me

All my traits are charming
I know you know that
They live beyond their means

You might consider that a failure

Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

I’ve had it with you
You’ve had it with me

Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

What shall it be?
What shall it be?
What shall it be?
What shall it be?

All my friends are heathens
They like to know that
It keeps them safe from harm

And that just might mean everything

I’m finished with you
Please be finished with me

I’ve had it with you
You’ve had it with me

That just might mean something

I’m finished with you
Please be finished with me

I’ve had it with you
You’ve had it with me

That just might mean everything

I’m finished with you
Please be finished with me

I’ve had it with you
You’ve had it with me

That just might mean something

Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa

That just might mean everything

I’m finished with you
Please be finished with me

I’ve had it with you
You’ve had it with me

That just might mean something

Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
Pa-pa pa-pa-pap pa-pa pa-pa, pa-pa-pa
