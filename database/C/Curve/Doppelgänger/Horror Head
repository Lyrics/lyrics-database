The fireworks red and green
I can see what the’re saying,
It’s you or me

You’re only small

A boxing ring with blackened walls
It can only see from the inside
Across the board

There’s a horror in my head when the blanket is gone
From the throne in my castle where I see the sun from

There’s a horror in my head when the blanket is gone
From the throne in my castle where I see the sun from

In the comfort of this room the challenge died
Remember you and me, we laughed till we cried

In the comfort of this room the challenge died
Remember you and me, we laughed till we cried
