Eyes in me see,
Nobody is perfect.
Not even you,
Not even you.

Crawl for me like a child
Just go back to what you were
’Cause I don’t like you
Anymore

I’ve got no problem with you, you can come in.
I just don’t want to upset you, so make your mind up.
Got to sharpen you
’Cause lillies dying in the front room.

Try to understand,
Nothing is easy
The first time ’round.
The first time ’round.

And anger’s are all we see
When you come, is that misery?

I’ve got no problem with you, you can come in.
I just don’t want to upset you, so make your mind up.
Got to sharpen you
’Cause lillies dying in the front room.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, oooh-yea.

I’ve got no problem with you, you can come in.
I don’t want to upset you, so make your mind up.
Got to sharpen you
’Cause lillies dying in the front room.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
Yeah, yeah, oooh-yea.
