A gift from God
A small creation
A prized possession
Without limitations

Behind these eyes
What do you see
That isn’t already yours
Already yours, already yours?

In fact, I never wanted anything more
In fact, I’ve never wanted anything less
Oh you shouldn’t treat me like a stranger
Do you see I have the same effect
Only this time on you?

Behind your eyes
What can I see
That isn’t already you
Already you, already you?

Voices of angels that I have heard
Voices of angels, I have heard
Voices of angels, I have heard
Voices of angels that I have heard

Behind these eyes
What can I see
That isn’t already there
Already yours, already there
Already, already yours?

(Don’t run away)
(Don’t run away)
(Don’t run away)
(Don’t run away)
(Don’t run away)
(Don’t run away)
