Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong
Hits from the bong

pick it, pack it
Fire it up, come along
And take a hit from the bong
Put the blunt down
Just for a second
Don't get me wrong
It's not a new method
Inhale
Exhale
Just got an ounce in the mail
I like a blunt or a big fat cone
But my double-barrel bong
Is gettin' me stoned
I'm skill it
There's water inside don't spill it
It smells like shit on the carpet
Still it
Goes down smooth when I get a clean hit
Of the skunky, phunky, smelly green shit
Sing my song
Puff all night long
As I take hits from the bong
Hits from the bong y'all

Hits from the bong
Can I get a… hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a… hit?

Hits from the bong
Can I get a… hit?
Hits from the bong
Can I get a… hit?

Let's smoke that bowl
Hit the bong
And then take that finger off of that hole
Plug it
Unplug it
Don't strain
I love you Mary Jane
She never complains
When I hit Mary
With that flame
I light up the cherry
She's so good to me
When I pack a fresh bowl I clean the screen
Don't get me stirred up
The smoke, through the bubbling water
Is makin' it pure so I got ta
Take my hit and hold it
Just like Chong
I get the bowl and I reload it
Get my four-footer and bring it on
As I take hits from the bong

Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?
Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?

Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?
Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?

Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?
Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?

Hits from the bong
Can i get a… hit?
