I’mma do my thing, let me tell you right now
Cuz I don’t know any other way of livin’ my life now
Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble
Some of you hustle and some of you just lookin’ for trouble
(some of you just lookin’ for trouble!)
I don’t follow or lead, tomorrow’s a dream
Pray to God to intervine on all the sorrow I’ve seen (U Know I mean?)
You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna
Nothin’ can stop you if that’s your type of persona (Persona!)
Life is short enough don’t make me say it 10 times (10Times!)
I’ll kick over for mine even in the end times (Times)
I can beat the system, come on, let’s say it with me
Show me some optimism, we can take over the city (We can take over the city!)

Real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin’ out around the way
Can’t stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won’t give it, but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I’mma get it anyway
I’mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I’mma get it anyway
I’mma get it anyway

There comes a time in your life, you gotta go for yours
Stay invaders like the battle of forever more
I stay pedal to the metal foot on the floor
I’mma keep on the streets, knockin’ down your doors
I’m by the dollar, like everybody oughtta be
Don’t burn nobody and make the money honestly
Open your home with the internet technology
I get it anyway just by the  economy
See I ain’t coughin’ unless it makes a profit
I’m droppin’ it so hot, chick, like everyday gossip
Regardless of the climate, I’m gonna get it every day
Even if the bullets spray, I’m gonna get it anyway

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin’ out around the way
Can’t stop, gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won’t give it but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I’mma get it anyway
I’mma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
I’mma get it anyway
I’mma get it anyway

Sing
(La, la, la, la, la)
You know we blazin’ up that
(La, la, la, la, la)
All around the world
(La, la, la, la, la)
Our peoples gettin’ money
(La, la, la, la, la)
Let me hear you sing

So let ’em hear the cellar by,  the collar
Makin’ it harder for you to wanna make an honest dollar
You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb
Tippin’ that bottle got you forgettin’ where you came from (Forgettin’ where you came from!)
But I’m the same one, where you think my name’s from?
I’mma keep it movin’ and never stop till the game’s done (Never stop till the game’s done!)
Forever we live it, forever we spit it, remember the minute
You witnessed the realest that ever did it (Quit it!)
Still I’m committed, no matter what I hear from the critic
People can see through a gimmick, I’m puttin’ on a clinic (I’m puttin’ on a clinic!)
We a troubled times, swervin’ through the double lines
You’re in a head on collision ’cause now you servin’ time (Now you servin’ time!)

This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day
Gangstas, hustlas, grindin’ out around the way
Can’t stop gotta be always on the paper chase
Educated, they won’t give it (Come on!), but I did it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imma get it anyway
(I get it anyway)
Regardless what the haters say
Imma get it anyway
Imma get it anyway

Sing!
(La la la la la)
You know we blazin’ up that
(La la la la la)
All around the world
(La la la la la)
Our peoples getting money
(La la la la la)

Let me hear you sing!
(La la la la la)
You know we blazin’ up that
(La la la la la)
All around the world
(La la la la la)
Our peoples getting money
(La la la la la)

Let me hear you sing!
(La la la la la)
You know we blazin’ up that
(La la la la la)
All around the world
(La la la la la)
Our peoples getting money
(La la la la la)
