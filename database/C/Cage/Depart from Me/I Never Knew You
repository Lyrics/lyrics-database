You’re always dying inside that much closer to home
On a crowded street corner surrounded by people all alone
Pain in the heart, rain in the dark, the womb is glum and bitter
She walks around the corner, it’s like she brought the sun with her
Then everything just brightened up, I couldn’t make this up
My fingers in my eyes as she walked by like I was waking up
And so many words, I couldn’t string a sentence together to bother her
I instantly forgot all my plans and started to follow her

It’s like the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

Your legs are long and toned, you must be walking home
I love the way your lips move when you’re talking on your phone
Intoxicating, truly due to your impurities
Plague every thought of you while I’m trailing you like you’re security
Lost, we couldn’t know our paths would cross but time knew it
Feet sticking out the window, a opportunity climbing through it
Pain for sale, looking to find a new taker
Chance to speak blown, when you looked at me I looked in the newspaper

Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me

I’m miles out of my way, creepy, I want more
Was gonna turn back but you stuck your key in your front door
I’m standing across the street, stars that aligned us to meet
Standing outside with your trash feeling incomplete
My finger aching for your doorbell like a random blog
Instead I lurk outside in the cold like an abandoned dog
Perish the thought, you should cherish the words that I got in my mouth
The only words that can truly explain how I got in your house

Because the sky opened and God handed you directly to me
I know it sounds crazy but so is life, I’m sinking
And feeling like your heart is beating solely for me
Unlikely, impossible, I couldn’t dream to think it
There’s something happening between us you can’t deceive
I’m so in over my head I’ve learned to breathe in it
Your eyes are screaming and you’re saying no baby to me
If there was a way out I think you would’ve taken it
My hands and arms are the only way that you can leave
Face to face for the first time, you feel what I’m feeling
Selfishly no longer breathing because of me
