It was just illusion
Stuck in my own bad air
I thought I had freedom, but
I was stuck there

I make
Choices without reason
Choices without reason
Invite strangers in and then leave them

He was just another man trying to teach me something
He was just another man trying to teach me something

I never expect much
From anyone
So I'm never disappointed
And I never have to trust

I make
Choices without reason
Choices without reason
Invite strangers in and then leave them

He was just another man trying to teach me something
He was just another man trying to teach me something
He was just another man trying to teach me something
He was just another man trying to teach me something
