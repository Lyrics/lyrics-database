Now maybe
I didn’t mean to treat you bad
But I did it anyway
And then maybe
Some would say your life was sad
But you lived it anyway
And so maybe
Your friends, they stand around, they watch you crumble
As you falter down to the ground
And then someday
Your friends, they stand beside as you were flying
Oh you were flying, oh so high
But then someday people look at you for what they call their own
They watch you suffer
Yeah they hear you calling home
And then some day we could take our time
To brush the leaves aside so you can reach us
But you left me far behind

Now maybe
I didn’t mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you’re left with what you had
But you couldn’t share the pain, no, no, no
Couldn’t share the pain, they watch you suffer

Now maybe I could have made my own mistakes
But I live with what I’ve known
And then maybe we might share in something rare
But won’t you look at where we’ve grown?
Won’t you look at where we’ve gone?
But then someday comes
Tomorrow holds a sense of what I feel for you in my mind
As you trip the final line
And that cold day when you lost control
Shame you left my life so soon you should have told me
But you left me far behind

Now maybe I didn’t mean to treat you oh so bad
Oh but I did it anyway
Now maybe some would say you’re left with what you had
But you couldn’t share the pain, no, no, no

No, no
Hell, no, no no no no
Oh, no
Damn, no

Now maybe I didn’t mean to treat you oh so bad
But I did it anyway
So now maybe baby some would say you’re left with what you had
But you couldn’t share the pain, no
I said times have changed your friends
They come and watch you crumble to the ground
They watch you suffer
Yeah, they hold you down
Hold you down
Now maybe oh oh, maybe
Oh I didn’t mean to treat you bad
But you left me far behind
Left me far behind
Left me far behind
