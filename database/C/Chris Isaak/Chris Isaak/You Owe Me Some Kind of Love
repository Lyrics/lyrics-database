Think of all the things we’ve done
And now, you’ve decided I’m not the one
A love like ours just can’t go on
Run away baby, have your fun

But

I, I, I, I
Don’t wanna hurt you, I don’t wanna see you cry
I, I, I, I
Just wanna hold you love tonight

You owe me some kind of love

I don’t wanna see you sad, I don’t want you
Be let down, I only want you
Say you love me and you need me
The way I love ya, please believe me

I, I, I, I
Don’t wanna hurt you, I don’t wanna see you cry
I, I, I, I
Lust wanna hold your love tonight

You owe me some kind of love
You owe me some kind of love

Think of all the things we’ve done
And now, you’ve decided I’m not the one
A love like ours just can’t go on
Run away baby, have your fun

But

I, I, I, I
Don’t wanna hurt you I don’t wanna see you cry
I, I, I, I
Just want you back I don’t want to fight

I, I, I, I
Just wanna hold your love tonight!

You owe me some kind of love
You owe me some kind of love

Help!
