Sick at heart and lonely
Deep in dark despair
When you want her only
Tell me where is she, where?

And if she says to you
That she don’t love me
Just give her my message
Tell her of my plea

And I know, if I could have her back again
I would never make her sad
I got a heart heart full of soul
I got a heart full of soul

She’s been gone such a long time
Longer than I can bear
But if she says she wants me
Tell her I’ll be there

And I know, if I could have her back again
I would never make her sad
I got a heart heart full of soul
I got a heart full of soul

Sick at heart and lonely, deep in dark despair
When you want her only, tell me where is she where?
And if she says to you, that she don’t love me
Just give her my message, tell her of my plea

And I know, if I could have her back again
I would never make her sad
I got a heart full of soul
I got a heart… full of soul
I got a heart… full of soul!
