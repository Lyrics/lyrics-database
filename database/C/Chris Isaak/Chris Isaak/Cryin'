Cry…
Cry…

You tell me stories that I wish were true
But I know better than believe in you
I keep on cryin’
I keep on cryin’

You talk in circles and you laugh at sin
I think it’s over then it starts again
I keep on cryin’
I keep on cryin’

You say that you love me,
that you’d never leave me
Cryin’
I keep on cryin’

Cry…
Cry…

Oh mama save my soul
Say you won’t hurt me no more
I keep on cryin’
I keep on cryin’

You say that you need me
That you’d never leave me
Cryin’
I keep on cryin’

Cry…
Cry…

You make it easy to cry

Oh mama save my soul
Oh mama save my soul

Keep on cryin’
Keep on cryin’
Keep on cryin’!
Cry…
