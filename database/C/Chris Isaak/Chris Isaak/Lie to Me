There is a woman far over the sea
Standing and waiting, praying for me
Here I lie sleeping, a girl by my side
Who am I hurting each time I lie?

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

There is a woman trying hard to be brave
The way that I hurt her has made her afraid
Things that I’m doing are breaking her heart
Still she’s pretending we’ll never part

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

I don’t care what people may say
I know everybody lies
I’m not trying to hurt my love
I’m only trying to get by

There is a woman far over the sea
Standing and waiting, praying for me
Here I lie guilty, a girl by my side
Who am I hurting each time I lie?

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie

Lie to me
Lie
Lie to me
Lie
