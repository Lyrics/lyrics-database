I keep on dancin’, dancin’
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
I find myself alone and thinking just of you
You got me dancin’, dancin’

Why don’t you help me?
Why don’t you guide me?
Why don’t you promise
To stand beside me?

There was once a man in a foreign land
In love with a woman he didn’t understand
Love is not a thing you command, love is something
That keeps you, keeps you dancin’, dancin’

Why don’t you help me?
Why don’t you guide me?
Why don’t you promise
To stand beside me?

I keep on dancin’, dancin’
Nothing left to say, nothing left to do
Find myself alone and thinking just of you
You’ve got me dancin’, dancin’

Why don’t you help me?
Why don’t you guide me?
Why don’t you promise
To stand beside me?

Dancin’, dancin’, dancin’
You’ve got me…

Oh-oh-oh
Help me, guide me
Why don’t you promise
You’ll stand beside me?

Help me…

Oh-oh-oh
