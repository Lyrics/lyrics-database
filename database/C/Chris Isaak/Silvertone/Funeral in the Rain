I wait, too long
I’ll die, If I’m alone
I wait, too shy
Love dies, I’m alone to cry

I’m walking, I keep on walking down the street
I’m watching, I keep on searching every face I meet
I loved her, but now I’ve lost her, love’s in vain
I watch a funeral in the rain

I’m walking, I keep on walking around the world
I’m talking, I keep on talking about a girl
I loved her but, now I’ve lost her, love’s in vain
I watch a funeral in the rain
I watch a funeral in the rain

All the world, knows the girl
All the world, knows she’s gone
She’s gone
she’s gone

I’m walking, I keep on walking around the clock
They’re watching, they keep talking, let them talk
I loved her, but now I’ve lost her, love’s in vain
I watch a funeral in the rain
I watch a funeral in the rain
I watch a funeral in the rain

She’s gone
She’s gone
She’s gone
She’s gone
