Let’s take a drive through the old town
Back past the place where we met
Some things are hard to remember
Some things you’ll never forget

Let’s take a walk down your old street
Who lives in you house today?
Let’s see if we can remember
All of the vows that we made

Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me
None of these things have changed
Nothing’s changed
Nothing’s changed

Young lovers stand in the shadows
New lovers taking our place
And though you’re gone, I remember
And I can still see your face

Kisses you gave me, the vows you made me
None of these things have changed
Nothing’s changed
Nothing’s changed
