Swan boats in daisy chains
Can’t seem to recall
My true given name
I see my footprints
How they come, how they go
Was that yesterday,
Or only a moment ago?

My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold

The past gives way
To a cold winter field
With ground below
Hard as steel
Beyond the hill
A distant song
But that hill
Keeps going on and on

My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold

Swan boats in daisy chains
Can’t seem to recall
Any given name
I see the footprints
How they come, how they go
Was that only a moment,
Or many years ago?

My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold

My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold

My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
My heart has gone
I’ve gone cold
