When the blood dries in my veins
And my heart feels no more pain
I know I'll be on my way
To heaven's door

I know when I'm not
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rise
Like before

I know when I'm not
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rise
Like before

I can feel
Something happening that I've never felt before
Hope this dream
Won't start dragging me away from heaven's door

I can feel
Something happening that I've never felt before
Hope this dream
Won't start dragging me away from heaven's door

When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking
I hope
Somebody's there

When my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air
I hope somebody cares

When the blood dries in my veins
And my heart feels no more pain
I know I'll be on my way
To heaven's door

I know when I'm not
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rise
Like before

I know when I'm not
I'll be hoping I don't drop
To a place where I will rise
Like before

I can feel
Something happening that I've never felt before
Hope this dream
Won't start dragging me away from heaven's door

When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking
I hope
Somebody's there

When my heart stops beating
And my lungs stop breathing
In air
I hope somebody cares

When my mind stops thinking
And my eyes stop blinking
I know
At the end
