You found out about it
you, but I doubt it
You won't hear me say his name
When I'm with you
Just one night I want to change
And undo

I can see you moving on
I can't see me moving on
How can you be moving on
Without me

Don't lose who you are
But when it's you
A broken heart
You won't hear me say his name
When I'm with you
Just one night I want to change
And undo

I've got no right to right this wrong
But when you said you'd hear me out
I thought that we could make this make this make this work

Say that you don't know
The single reason why
We can't have it all
There's nothing that I want more than you
That I want more than you
That I want more than you

Say that you don't know
The single reason why
Say that you don't know
The single reason why
We can't have it all
There's nothing that I want more than you
That I want more than you

Say that you don't know
The single reason why
We can't have it all
There's nothing that I want more than you
That I want more than you

Say that you don't know
The single reason why
We can't have it all
There's nothing that I want more than you
That I want more than
