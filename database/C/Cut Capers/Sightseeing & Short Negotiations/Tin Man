I wake up every morning
I don't know what it is
I don't know what it is
That makes me feel like this
Fills me with this feeling
Like nothing else exists
Like nothing else exists
I lose myself in this

Too close, who knows
Where this feeling goes
Secrets, keep us locked up in this thing
Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; I don't want a tin man
Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; A tin man ain't my friend

I reach out in the darkness
I'm on my own again
How many shots will it take
For you to let me in
Working hard for something
Something just ain't right
You shut me out, change the locks
I walk out in the night

Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; I don't want a tin man
Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; A tin man ain't my friend

Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; I don't want a tin man
Lift me up
Like I want you to do
Understand; I don't want a tin man
