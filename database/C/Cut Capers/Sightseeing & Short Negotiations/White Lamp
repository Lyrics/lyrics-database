Never away been beyond the border
I've never seen the northen lights
I know what I am
And what I am is not enough for you
I've never dreamed of something warmer
I've never known when the moment is right
I know what I am
And what I am is not enough for you

'Cause I'm ready
To take a leap of faith on me
I'm not scared
And I'm not worried
And I know it's time to leave you behind
Come alive
I'm on my way

I'm gonna walk the streets Barcelona
I'm gonna find out what is truly mine
I know what I am
And I'll do it all, but not for you
(You)

'Cause I'm ready
To take a leap of faith on me
I'm not scared
And I'm not worried
And I know it's time to leave you behind
Come alive

'Cause I'm ready
To take a leap of faith on me
I'm not scared
And I'm not worried
And I know it's time to leave you behind
Come alive
I'm on my way
Uh, I'm on my way
I'm on my way
