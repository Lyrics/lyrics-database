Like I'm falling
Falling out
Never turning
On your love
Like I'm burning
A 
When I'm smiling
And I can't hide it

Going "Ah, again"
Going "Ah"

Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out
Now my world is spiraling out

They're all playing
All around
And I'm sleeping
On a cloud
And I'm burning
Sugar with you
