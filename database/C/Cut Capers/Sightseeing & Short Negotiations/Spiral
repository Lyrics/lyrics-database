Like I'm falling
Falling out
Never turning
On your love
Like I'm burning
Without a permit
When I'm smiling
And I can't hide it

Going "Ah, again"
Going "Ah"

Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out
Now my world is spiraling out

They're all playing
All around
And I'm sleeping
On a cloud
And I'm burning
Sure up with you
'Cause it's deep in
It's what I can do

Going "Ah, again"
Going "Ah"

Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out
Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out

Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out
Never know when enough is enough
Now my world is spiraling out
