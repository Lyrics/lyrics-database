Standing at the platform
Waiting at you on this time
Making my way back home
Spinning out inside my mind
It's not the same without you
So I hold on tight

Because I feel just right
When I'm with you
With every lonely night
We've paid our dues
Just to see your smile
And love in your eyes
We've walked this lonely mile
This is the place I wanna

Three days in your arms
And it's that time again
I don't wanna be alone now
Think that I'mma stay with friends
It's not the same without you
When my whole world comes undo
It's not the same without you
So I hold on tight

Because I feel just right
When I'm with you
With every lonely night
We've paid our dues
Just to see your smile
And love in your eyes
We've walked this lonely mile
This is the place I wanna be
This is the place I wanna be

(Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)
(On my calendar, yeah)
(Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)
(On my calendar, yeah)
(Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)
(On my calendar, yeah)
((Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)

(Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)
(On my calendar, yeah)
(Waiting for you)
(Yes, I'm gonna be there)
(Cross all the days)

Тhis is the place I wanna be
Mhm
Тhis is the place I wanna
(Place I wanna be, place I wanna be)
(Place I wanna be, place I wanna be)
(Place I wanna be, place I wanna be)
(Place I wanna be, place I wanna be)
Тhis is the place I wanna be
