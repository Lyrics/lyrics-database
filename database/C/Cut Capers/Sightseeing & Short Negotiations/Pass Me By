Looking through the glass around me
Seperated by design
Now I see the world through your eyes
And reimagine what is mine

Never knowing if I know
That extraordinary moment
Where this world becomes my own
And I am free

Been searching such a long time
For something I can call mine
And now I found it here with you
And I won't let it pass me by
Oh no
I won't let it pass me by
I won't let it pass me by

Now I'm changing my position
I break it down
And start again

Never knowing if I know
That extraordinary moment
Where this world becomes my own
And I am free

Been searching such a long, long time
For something I can call just mine
And now I found it here with you
And I won't let it pass me by
Oh no
I won't let it pass me by
I won't let it pass me by
I won't let it pass me by

Never knowing if I know
That extraordinary moment
Where this world becomes my own
Where this world becomes my own
Never knowing if I know
That extraordinary moment
Where this world becomes my own
And I am free

Been searching such a long, long time
For something I can call my own
And now I found it here with you
And I won't let it pass me by
Oh no
I won't let it pass me by
I won't let it pass me by
Oh
