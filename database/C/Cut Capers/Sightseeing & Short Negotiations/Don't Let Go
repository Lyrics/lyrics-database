Curveballs always arrive
Just when you thought you had it right
Suddenly faced with my darkest fears
Will I stay or disappear

So can you hold my hand 'til the sun comes up
Will you tell me that I'm more than enough
Hold me tight when I can't see for tears
Steady my breath 'til I see clear
Oh, don't let go
Don't let go

How's your day been darling
Won't you come sit here a while
See, there's no judgement here
Just love that's yours
So let me see behind your smile

And I will hold your hand 'til the sun comes up
I will tell you that you're more than enough
Hold you tight when you can't see for tears
Steady you breath 'til you see clear
Don't let go
Don't let go

Curveballs always arrive
Just when you thought you had it right
Suddenly faced with my darkest fears
Will I stay or disappear

So can you hold my hand 'til the sun comes up
Will you tell me that I'm more than enough
Hold me tight when I can't see for tears
Steady my breath 'til I see clear
Oh, don't let go
Don't let go

Don't let go
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Don't let go
(Don't let go, don't let go)
Don't let go
(There's no judgement here, so)
(So hold my hand 'til the sun comes up)
(There's no judgement here, so)
(So hold my hand 'til the sun comes up)
