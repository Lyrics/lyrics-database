These lilac thoughts collide inside and cloud my vision
But I take control
Smoke and mirrors, problem here is I reflect upon my every move

But I'm on my way up
And I'm on my way outta this
But I'm on my the way up
And I'll never come down again
On my way up
On my way up

These castle walls, built long ago, barely standing
And they're overgrown
Standing here through all these years
Thoughts collected I'm the one who knows

That I'm on my way up
And I'm on my way outta this
I'm on my way up
I'll never come down again
There's a million different reasons why I know I'll be just fine
And I'm on my way up
And I'm on my way outta here

And it's too easy to be thinkin'
That there's nothin' that I can do here
But that ain't right
No, that ain't right at all
And yes, some nights are long, some fights cut hard like broken glass
But I'll be getting through this with my head up, standing tall
Standing tall

I'm on my way up
(I'm on my way outta this)
I'm on my way up
(I'm on my way outta this)

And I'm on my way up
I'm on my way outta this
And I'm on my way up
I'll never come down again
There's a million different reason why I know I'll be just fine
And I'm all the way up
And I'm on my way outta this
