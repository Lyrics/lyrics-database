Just keep me in the dark
Don't wanna know where you are
And if you wanna slide back in
Make a new beginning, I won't answer

Just keep me in the dark
Dark
And if you wanna slide back in
Make a new beginning, I won't answer
Just keep me in the
Just keep me in the dark
Just keep me in the dark

How many times that I've tried to say
"We can carry on, when my mind is made"
We both know it and the heart's a mess
Wish you all the best, but I ask

Just keep me in the dark
Dark
And if you wanna slide back in
Make a new beginning, I won't answer
Just keep me in the
Just keep me in the dark
Just keep me in the dark

Shut my eyes and try to breathe
Stronger than you would believe
Shut me out and lose the key
Just keep me, keep me

Dark
Dark
Just keep me in the dark
Dark
Just keep me in the dark (uh)
Dark (uh)
Just keep me in the dark (uh)
Just keep me in the dark
Uh
