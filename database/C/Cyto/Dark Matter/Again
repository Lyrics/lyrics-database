Lost my sense of tryin’
Speechless, weak and silent
Again
Again

Undertowed resistance
Battles, bail-out, blizzards
Again
Again

Could you wake me up
When I fall in deep-deep sleep?
Could you save my soul?
Can’t escape the beast

Lost control, no resistance
I kiss this brave new system
Again
Again

Everyone in position
I’m just a part of algorithm
Ahead
Ahead

Could you wake me up
When I fall in deep-deep sleep?
Could you save my soul?
Can’t escape the beast

Let me out!
What will ever remain?
Let me out!
Underneath the sprout of complaint

Lost my sense of tryin’
Speechless, weak and silent
Again
Again

Let me out!
What will ever remain?
Let me out!
Forgive me again

Let me out!
What will ever remain?
Let me out!
Underneath the sprout of complaint

Of complaint
