I’m a thought in your head — think me
A light in the dark — reach me
A small divine spark – steal me
This is your DNA – embrace me
In this endless delay – trace me
Fading out and away – hold me

(You)
(You)
(You)
(You)

I’m the source of your life – find me
Though you’ve been blind – see me
Crawling under your skin – feel me
Ride on my waves – hear me
On a poundering pulse – touch me
And haunt like a ghost – heal me

(You)
(You)

I’m a deleted line in a secret file
I’m a faded cry of a past gone life
My signal’s losing gain, rush of adrenaline
Cannot hide, cannot hide, cannot hide again from you!
Trapped in a closing scene, sky full of violins
Cannot hide, cannot hide, cannot hide again from you!

From you
(You)
From you
(You)
