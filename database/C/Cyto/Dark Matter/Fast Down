On a thin red line
Break the rules to survive
No control, we will fall
Ignore the system failed — It’s gone

All is lost, all is lost
And the console went black due to a short
All is lost, all is lost
Can’t stand the moans of the dying ship and with a broken shield and axial shift now

Fast down, fast down
All the stars are gone, we’re gonna make it
Feel down far from home, the noise of disintegration
The fear of tempting fate

Main bus B — analyzed
And a bunch of detailed things — untried
All is lost, all is lost, and the perfect sky is torn
And our hope for new daybreak’s gone, yea

Fast down, fast down
All the stars are gone, we’re gonna make it
Feel down, feel down, bring the boys back home
No, we don’t break it

Fast down, fast down
All the stars are gone, we’re gonna make it
Nothing, nothing
Oh nothing more, but endless space!

Fast down, fast down
All the stars are gone, we’re gonna make it
Feel down, feel down, bring the boys back home
No, we don’t break it

Last time, far from home
We have a go for the new entry
Fast down, fast down
Full thrust on the booster engines

The booster engines

No, we don’t break it

We’re gonna make it
