Each time
I get a feeling that feels right
Think twice
There are decisions that change lives

I can see
Though in the midst of the night
I’ve sailed the darkest seas
I’m gonna get in too deep

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Would you come into my life, ain’t have no fear
There’s nothing left to steal

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Get to come into my life, you don’t have to reveal
Or are you turning a different wheel?

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Would you come into my life, would you take me home?
Yes, you’re gonna make it real

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Would you come and give me an eye?

Each time
I get this feeling to be high
Each time
I make decisions that change mind

I’m gonna break my neck!
Or getting over instead

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Could you come into my life? — But you cannot retain
A loose chain of moments in time

I can feel right now
I can feel right now
Would you come and gimme a smile?

I can feel now
I can feel now
I can feel now
Yes, I feel now

I can feel now
I can feel now
I can feel now
I can feel now
