These are the words of the dying:

Red and white, in time of silence
Soul on fire, fog on the windscreen

Eternal violence of the mind
(Time is remaining)
(Time is repeating)
(Life in awaiting)
(Times are a-changing)
(Conflict repeating)
Tonight

These are the words of the dying:

Caught in light, so sad and winding
Alone at night to scale the distance

Eternal violence of the mind
(Time is remaining)
(Time is repeating)
(Life in awaiting)
(Times are a-changing)
(Conflict repeating)
Tonight

These are the rights of our children:

Black and white, so charmed in twilight
Eyes of fire will share the distance

Eternal violence of the mind
(Time is remaining)
(Time is repeating)
(Life in awaiting)
(Times are a-changing)
(Conflict repeating)
Tonight
