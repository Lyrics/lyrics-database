Aaah...

Aaah...

Underneath the stars
Where I
Underneath the stars
Breathe in
Where you are unraveling

Sensation
And I know you’re there
Under the surface
Utopia
Unraveling
Utopia
Breathe in

??? by myself
Your breath away
...
... say I

Somewhere out there
Where I am
Somewhere out there
I know you feel the same
Where you are breathing

Sensation
And I know you’re there
Under the surface
Utopia
Unraveling
Utopia
Breathe in

Where you are
You’ve been traveling
And you’re searching
As I lay sleeping

????
I, I, I
Aaa, ah ah
