I never asked for anyone to listen, and I never asked for
anyone to take my words to heart. I’ve let myself become a target based on
nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won’t lie to
myself. If you’re searching for safety you can find it somewhere else, and I
won’t mind. I’ve never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn’t give us an
excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest. We will turn our
hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.
