As time passes by
I feel everything changing but me
I will not feel the sting of defeat
I’ve watched days become months
become years
and I’ve lost all faith in progression
I will never allow myself to exchange all my morals for acceptance
If this is truly where I belong
I’ll fucking be here until the end of time
I’ve watched everyone around me jump ship
and I hope they’re left to sink
The current will carry us
I am proud of all that I’ve become
and I’m well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction
And life is your’s to destroy
I just can’t respect your decision
I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty
I watched you do away with everything
I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
You were the catalyst for your downfall
But where the rest have failed
we are bound to succeed
And mark my fucking words
as long as we are breathing
we will overcome
The integrity that we emanate day-to-day is unparalleled
and our efforts will not go unnoticed
We will be remembered
