Why do I need to justify my opinion, after all that I&#x2019;ve seen and
 done? And year after year, we give our everything to get nothing in return. The
 time has come for things to change. We don&#x2019;t need your adoration, but we demand
 your respect. I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of
 labor. The places we&#x2019;ve been, the faces we&#x2019;ve seen, the months spent far from
 home. This is what moves us. This is what we&#x2019;ve grown accustom to. What we will
 leave behind can not be measured in a dollar figure. There&#x2019;s a much deeper
 meaning than that. I can&#x2019;t wait until the day when we&#x2019;ve surpassed everything
 that gave you a false sense of importance. I want you to question yourself. I
 want you to watch you slip away. I want you to realize that your existence has
 meant nothing. I hate you more than you could ever fucking know. And I hate
 you for making me feel like this. I know deep down that I&#x2019;m a good person, but
 my patience is wearing thin. The best retaliation I can think of, would be to
 let you know that for once in my life, I&#x2019;m truly happy. I&#x2019;m more than content
 with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don&#x2019;t need to
 justify my opinion after everything we&#x2019;ve been through. And year after year, we
 give our everything and what we receive in return, I can&#x2019;t explain with words.
 I&#x2019;m so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the
 world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it&#x2019;s so far down.)
