This is the only thing I have worth holding onto
I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see
But still I fight day after day ’cause this is all I’ve ever wanted my life to be
And I push everything I’ve ever loved away
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking
To keep myself from sinking

If I find the bad in everything,
I can never be attached
I’m trying to find a balance
I’m trying to find a way
But every choice I’ve ever made brings me anywhere but home
But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms
And I will never regret my decision
This is the only thing that makes me feel alive

Makes me feel alive

I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head
I’m searching for common ground between all that I am and all that you need me to be
I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it
A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared
I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink

You know where to find me
I keep my composure and assume my place, in front of those who I love most
You’re the reason why we’re here
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink
I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink
