Everything ends, at least that’s what we hope for.
Plagued by our past and we’re doomed to repeat ourselves.
Afraid of the thoughts that dance in revolutions, and circle the mind like a snare: Binding me, I’m just trying to feel something.
Cold and stale, searching for warmth inside of every promise wasted.
You wrap yourself around me, but I can only sense your presence.
You’re nothing but a carcass.
I’ve never felt more alone than I did on those nights I spent watching you sleep.
You’re the furthest thing from me, and you’ve been there from the start.
An empty shell, you’re vacant and it scares me to death. One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.
Fortunately, I know that I’m not worth it.
Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.
Why did I think that this time it’d be different?
I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.
I tried by hardest but I couldn’t make you feel a fucking thing.
