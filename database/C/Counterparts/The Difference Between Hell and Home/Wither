I am more than familiar with feeling empty.
The conduit; I allow myself to drain.
My mind is the trench in which I will be buried.
Watch me wither away.
Put me out of my misery.
I can only find solace in sleep, a sub-conscious sanctuary, I am longing to be set free.
Yet I am the one who holds the key.
I am the one who holds the key.
A lifetime spent trying to place the blame on anyone or anything.
This is not who I am.
I am not who I used to be.
Set me free!
Set me free!
Set me free!
