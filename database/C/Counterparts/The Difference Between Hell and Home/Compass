The weight came and went and took my will to live.
Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what’s left of me.
That’s when breathing became routine, and I could feel myself fading.
Stranded.
No direction, I am a compass.
Constantly spinning.
Constantly searching for the end.
Never reaching our destination.
But the goal was never when, or where, or who…; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you’d never let me go.
But I don’t know what to believe anymore.
Affection allowed me to let the light in, the fear made me whole again.
Help me rebuild my broken bones.
Help me regain my sanity.
But with caution always present, our pasts manifest themselves.
And we act as if this is what we deserve.
But I refuse to fail again.
I’d force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave.
I watched the world give up on me.
I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream, now i long to feel your breath pass through my arteries.
The goal was never when, or where, or who…; It was only you.
I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there.
You promised you’d never let me go.
But I don’t know what to believe anymore.
Fill me with your faith and let me leave.
I’m scratching at my skin to take my mind off the absence we’ve created.
The lines blur together like the veins in my arms.
And I wish I wasn’t so alone, You are the difference between Hell and Home.
