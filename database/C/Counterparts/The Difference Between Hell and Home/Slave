If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again.
The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution.
Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence.
Show me the meaning of happiness.
Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven’t slept for days.
I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see.
Are we being strung along or are we just strung out?
The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole.
How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last?
Your words like rope, tied around my throat.
Remove the earth beneath me.
Watch my spirit sink.
