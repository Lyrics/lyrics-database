Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness.
Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind…; and will I ever really let it come to surface?
You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you’re told.
Serenity is a beautiful hoax.
A liar.
I have the whole world convinced of my contentment.
No truth in this.
I’ve lost count of all the times I made it home alive…; and wished I hadn’t.
Expose me for all that I am.
The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness.
I’m left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker.
Life is what’s killing me.
I hate the fact that I’m just fine.
Forever seeking something to take responsibility.
Life is what’s killing me.
I hate the fact that I’m alive.
Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality.
At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn’t want to die.
I’d work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds.
But I know I’d just be counting down the minutes until I’m miserable again.
