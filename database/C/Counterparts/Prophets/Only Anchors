When you’re reduced to living everyday
Carrying the weight of your conscience on your back,
Just know it can be lifted.
And you can be victorious in this war against yourself.
You’ve got the strength inside to turn this all around.
And I can only speak from experience,
The rest is up to you.
Whether you’re stuck in the past,
Or lost in the future,
This is for you.
I’m standing my ground,
Living for right now.
And I’m finally free.
Only anchors can keep me from moving forward.
