To quote from Whitman
"O me! O life!… of the questions of these recurring;
Of the endless trains of the faithless of cities fill’d with the foolish;
What good amid these, O me, O life?

Answer.

That you are here that life exists, and identity;
That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.
That the powerful play goes on, and you will contribute a verse.
What will your verse be?
