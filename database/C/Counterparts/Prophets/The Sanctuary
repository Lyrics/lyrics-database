We are now rooted in the ground that we were born into
And this is where we come from,
Where we will remain.
This place may have its’ flaws,
But I can always call the pavement we now stand upon ’my home’.
This is our home.
Through both the areas of wealth and poverty,
I appreciate every inch of our city.
And I don’t know if I could ever leave.
Our sanctuary,
Our stomping ground,
Our territory,
Our fucking home.
Love where you came from,
This is your home.
This is my home.
