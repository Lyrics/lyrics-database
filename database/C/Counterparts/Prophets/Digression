Our once-solid path is starting to diverge
And the space between us growing ever greater makes it hard for me to breathe.
But no amount of distance can change my feelings for you.
How can it be that a day I’ve always dreamed of,
Could also be a day that I wished would never come?
And we are slowly becoming two very different people,
But I won’t give you up without a fight.
This is everything I’ve ever meant to say to you.
You could be thousands of miles away,
But I’ll still see you when I close my eyes.
We’ve come too far to let our story end like this,
And we’ve come too far to let what we’ve built fall apart.
We both know this is love. I will never forget you.
