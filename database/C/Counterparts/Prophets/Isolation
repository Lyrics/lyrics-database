The best news I’ve ever heard was when you said you wouldn’t leave
Because I know the distance would tear us apart.
And all the things you said,
Wouldn’t mean a thing if you weren’t here with me.
So as you turn your back to me,
I just want to let you know that I could never do this to you.
This is where our roads divide and they split in two,
And I will never see you again.
But I respect your choice.
The familiar pain sets in again,
But I can’t let this drag me down.
It’s things like this that made me who I am today.
It’s thing like this that helped to shape/make me who I am today,
It’s every hardship that I’ve faced.
And I’ve lost hope in myself,
But I just want you to know:
As everyday goes by,
I must accept that you’re now living your own life.
