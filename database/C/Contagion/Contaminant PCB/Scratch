Scratch!

It’s a disease of the mind
Body stops, no definitions left or right
It’s a release in the mind
Dark revelations in black and white

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratching, scraping, breaking, shaking
Losing yourself over to them
Ripping, tearing
When the mind stops the nightmare begins

It’s a life you cannot see, never touch
Lost in a world you can never believe
Knife cuts but you will not bleed, body shocks
Trapped by the waves that drown you to sleep

It’s a life you cannot lead
(Thoughts lost in an endless sea)

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratching, scraping, breaking, shaking
Losing yourself over to them
Ripping, tearing
When the mind stops the nightmare begins

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratch!

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratching, scraping, breaking, shaking
Losing yourself over to them
Ripping, tearing
When the mind stops the nightmare begins

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratch!

Release the pressure that builds within
Scratch!

Scratch!
