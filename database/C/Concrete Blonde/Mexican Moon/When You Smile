I dreamed last night I was born a hundred years ago
But when I woke up I was lost with only one place to go
When you smile, I don’t know what to do
’Cause I could lose everything in a minute or two, ye-ye-ye

It’s not fair to put you against all of the years behind me
But history kind of pales when you and me are aligned

When you smile, I don’t know what to do
’Cause I could lose everything in a minute or two
And it seems like the end of the world
When you smile

Well there’s never been a man who’s been anymore than bones in a sack
But it doesn’t take much to hold the possibilities back

When you smile, I don’t know what to do
’Cause I could lose everything in a minute or two
And it seems like the end of the world
When you smile

When you smile, I don’t know what to do
’Cause I could lose everything in a minute or two
And it seems like the end of the world
Yes, it seems like the end of the world
Yes, it seems like the end of the world

When you smile
When you smile
When you smile
When you smile
