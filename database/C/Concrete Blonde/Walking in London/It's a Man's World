Well, it’s a man’s, man’s, man’s, man’s world
But it wouldn’t be nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl

Ah…

Man made the cars
To take us over the road
Man made the trains
To carry his man-made load

Man has made everything
That he possibly can
He’s busy making money
To buy from other men

Yes, it’s a man’s, man’s, man’s, man’s world
But it wouldn’t be nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Oh…

Man made the electric light
To take us out of the dark
Man made the boats on the water
They say Noah made the ark

You man have made everything
That you possibly can
You’re so busy making money
To buy from other men

Yes, it’s a man’s, man’s, man’s world
But it wouldn’t be nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl

Lost! (lost, lost, lost)
Well, he’s lost in his wilderness
Well, he’s lost!
Lost on his bitterness

Ah, yes…

Yes, it’s a man’s, man’s, man’s, man’s world
But it wouldn’t be nothing
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl

Man said he loved the little bitty baby girls
And the little bitty baby boys
Tries so hard to make them happy
With his man-made toys

Man’s making everything
That he possibly can
Busy making his almighty money
To buy from other men

Yes, it’s a man’s, man’s, man’s world
Wouldn’t be nothing
Without a woman or a girl

Without a woman
Without a woman
Without your woman, yeah
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl
Without a woman or a girl
