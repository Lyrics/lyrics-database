I took a cheap shot,
A clean miss.
Burnin’ my defenses by the shakin of her hips,

And then she
Moves in,
A quick kiss,
Breathing down my neck,
She had me wrapped around her wrist.

I try to
Break loose,
Tight grip,
Knocking me unconscious when she bit her bottom lip.

It was a
Lost cause,
A fast fight,
She ain’t taking any prisoners
And she’s through playing nice.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she’s a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you’re so tough,
Baby put your hands up."

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she’s a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you’re so tough,
Baby put your hands up."
Yeah.

And so I
Break off.
I gave in.
Feeling pretty good about the trouble that I’m in.

She got me
Beat down,
And bruised up.
I’m bleeding, barely breathing, but I can not get enough.

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she’s a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you’re so tough,
Baby put your hands up."

Loaded the bullets with my blood in the rounds.
Yeah she’s a sweet six shooter,
She knows how to get down.
Until the kick-back,
When my heart hits the ground.
She said,
"You think you’re so tough,
Baby put your hands up."
Yeah.

She gets me deep in the chest,
Straight through my bullet-proof vest.
She kisses like a grenade,
Like a blade, or Bayonet.

She gets me deep in the chest,
Straight through my bullet-proof vest.
She kisses like a grenade,
Like a blade, or Bayonet.
