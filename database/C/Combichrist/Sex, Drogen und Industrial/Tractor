You are like a sports car
You are so fast
You smell of sex and money
And you can go far

But I am like a tractor
I am slow but I am fit
And eventually I’ll find you
I’ll crush you like a lil’ shit

But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor

I am like a tractor
I, I, I, I, I, I…

You are like a sports car
You are so fast
You smell of sex and money
And you can go far

But I am like a tractor
I am slow but I am fit
And eventually I’ll find you
I’ll crush you like a lil’ shit

But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor

But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor
But I am like a tractor

But I am like a tractor
