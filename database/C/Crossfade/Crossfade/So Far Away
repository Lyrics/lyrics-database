I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
Now I’m blaming you for everything

No more holding it in
How many years can I pretend
Nothing never goes the way it should
No more sitting in this place
Hoping you might see it my way
’Cause I don’t think you ever understood
That what I’m looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

I’m so far away
I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
I’m so far away
Now I’m blaming you for everything

No more waiting for the end
Of every day that I will spend
Wishing that I only had a choice
No more pushing you away
’Cause I will be busy watching things going my way
Never looking back on this anymore
Because what I’m looking for are the answers
To why these questions never go away

I’m so far away
I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
I’m so far away
Now I’m blaming you for everything

I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
Now I’m blaming you for (everything)

(I’m so far away)

Hey hey, watch me wave
Goodbye to yesterday
Nothing left in my way
Hey hey, I’ve been saved
With sun shining on my pain
Getting me through this day
Hey hey, watch me wave
Goodbye to yesterday
Nothing left in my way
Feels so good to say

I’m so far away
I’ve been changing but you’ll never see me now
I’m so far away
Now I’m blaming you for everything

Now I’m blaming you

(I’m so far away)
