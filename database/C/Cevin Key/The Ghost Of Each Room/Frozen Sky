[blinding madness]
[blinding madness]
[blinding madness]
[blinding madness]

Could I rot, if life gave out?
Could I rot, if life gave out?

See a vision

Reach at a high, altitude is on fire
Red again, read a lie
Everyone is on fires
I’m seeing it
I am seeing it

Aimed at his side
Cut across to divide
Up and down, what inside?
Hold on to a lie
You believe in it
You believe in it

Between a near
Somewhere over there
When I do try and fight
Can’t recollect the evil deed
Sure wear those clothes
I’m washing out the blood I know
More tomorrow, our deafened lies
Look toward a frozen sky

Frozen sky
