(Are we rolling?)
(Okay)

It’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright, it’s alright
It’s been a long-long road of dreamin’
It’s ok, it’s ok, it’s ok, it’s ok
’Cause we’ll all get there, believe me

One can become so willing
Hypnotised by untold thing
Fantasised by the beginning
As if such knowledge joy will bring

They like to try to fantasise
Slay their friends who criticise
Feeling righteous, in power
And up high

Maybe we all don’t have to be tall?
Maybe we don’t have to force our beliefs on each other?
Ah, maybe I’ll show we are not meant to know
Like an unborn child doesn’t need to know its mother, oh

But it don’t matter, no, why should you care?
These are just dreams in our heads that we share
Just dreams, hallucination
To deny

All we know
Is that light shines and things grow
All that’s real
Is the moment right now you can feel

So be sure to feel something positive
Feeling is all we can choose
If you happen to feel it the opposite
Ask of who stands in your shoes

(Oh, Satan took you by the hand)
(You’ll be preaching things you don’t understand)
(Getting all you folks cloned and clanned, my love, oh yeah)

(Oh, you gonna wake up one day)
(Having fought for things you can’t explain)
(Having spent your life causing pain, not love, oh yeah)

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
