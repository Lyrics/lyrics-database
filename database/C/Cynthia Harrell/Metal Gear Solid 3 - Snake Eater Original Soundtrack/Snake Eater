What a thrill
With darkness and silence through the night
What a thrill
I’m searching and I’ll melt into you
What a fear in my heart
But you’re so supreme!

I give my life
Not for honor, but for you (snake eater)
In my time, there’ll be no one else
Crime, it’s the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I’m still in a dream, snake eater

Someday you go through the rain
Someday you feed on a tree frog
It’s ordeal, the trial to survive
For the day we see new light

I give my life
Not for honor, but for you (snake eater)
In my time, there’ll be no one else
Crime, it’s the way I fly to you (snake eater)
I’m still in a dream, snake eater

I’m still in a dream, snake eater

(Snake eater)
