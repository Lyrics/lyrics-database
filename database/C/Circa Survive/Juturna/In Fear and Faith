Can we last through the winter
The water’s starting to freeze
The only one who remembers
Taking the wrong step falling in front of me
This body’s already aging
These nights are already long
And if I last through the winter I swear to you now, I wont call

Congratulations, go home now

Will we last through the winter
Will we make it to see
I never wanted a partner
And I never loved you
Now you are free to leave
This heart is already frozen
I can’t remember to thaw
And if I last through the winter
I swear to you now, I won’t call

Congratulations, go home now

It’s too late it’s too late
They won’t let go
I’ve followed five foot steps through that open door, open door
It’s too late its too late
They won’t let go
I’ve followed five foot steps through that open door, open door

It must be buried under the heart
That makes this place persistent
You’ll find in time, the gate’s been open and
I’ve been wondering, if you’d been real with us

It’s too late…

It’s too late it’s too late
They won’t let go
I’ve followed five foot steps through that open door, open door
It’s too late its too late
They won’t let go
I’ve followed five foot steps through that open door, open door

Start, stop, and go
You’ve been dying for, you’ve been dying for
