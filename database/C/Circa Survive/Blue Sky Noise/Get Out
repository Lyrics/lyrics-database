I can't get started from the part
Where I left off yesterday
Should have spent my time a little wiser

I sat alone, guilty of sin
Waiting for words to come,
From out of my head
Still making sense to anyone?

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

Get out
Get out

Lock myself up in a room
Without a window just to see
If it was any easier to breathe (I was wrong)
Never underestimate the daylight
The air is so much easier to breathe

I can't wait to understand the reason
I've yet to translate any meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out

There's no meaning
Besides, it's not worth it to try

Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out
Get out
