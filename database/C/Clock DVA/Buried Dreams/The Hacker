A digital murder
Programmed by mathematical terrorists
Outside of mortal boundaries
Silently hacking
A binary plague
Serving information
This is the time of the hacker
This is the code of the hacker
This is the hacker
An algebra of fear

Within the language of machines
Uninfringed my human emotions
Within global systems
Silently moving
A digital maze
Cutting information
This is the way of the hacker
This is the extremity of the hacker
This is the hacker
Protect now or be erased forever

A binary virus
Unleashed by subversive programmers
Inside corporate systems
Silently eating
The endemic wave
Erasing information
This is the sign of the hacker
This is the genius of the hacker
This is the hacker
Learn now
Or be cut down forever
