[Here the mirror of dreams of beauty]
[Here the looking glass of pride and ruined vanity]
[This is your glass of darkness]

Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see the echo?

Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear yourself?

Glass embrace
Glass embrace
Glass embrace
Emit refractions

I can see
I can see
I can see
Phonetized apparitions

Look into
Look into
Look into
Absolute resonance

Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
The imitation of noise?

Can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can you feel the image?

In your face
In your face
In your face
Emit refractions

I can see
I can see
I can see

[Here the mirror of dreams of beauty]

[Here the looking glass of pride and ruined vanity]

[This is your glass of darkness]

Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see the echo?

Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear yourself?

Glass embrace
Glass embrace
Glass embrace
Emit refractions

I can see
I can see
I can see
Phonetized apparitions

Look into
Look into
Look into
... spectre

Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
The imitation of noise?

Can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can you feel?
Can you feel the image?

In your face
In your face
In your face
Emit refractions

I can see
I can see

[This is your glass of darkness]

Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see?
Can you see the echo?

Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear?
Can you hear yourself?

I can see
I can see
I can see
Phonetized apparition

Can you feel?
Can you feel?
In the sound mirror?
