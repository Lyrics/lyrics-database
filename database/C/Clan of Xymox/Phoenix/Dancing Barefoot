She is benediction
She is addicted to thee
She is the root connection
She is connecting with thee

She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on he
Chosen, she

I’m dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

She is recreation
She’s intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation
That he is levitating with she

Here I go
Well, I don’t know why
I float so ceaselessly
Could it be he’s taken over me?

I’m dancing barefoot
In mid-air I spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

I’m dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
