Romeo and Juliet
Louis and Mlle. Antoinette
Napoleon and Josephine
Mickey and the Rodent Queen

Antony and Cleopatra
Nicholas and Alexandra
Ken and Barbie, Dick and Jane
Well, Superman and Lois Lane

I am not impressed
I love you the best
(Not impressed)
I am not impressed
Just a bunch of losers
A lot of fools
Long list of victims
Oh, not all that cool
We’ve got nothing in this world
To live up to

I’ll never kill you, this I swear
Then kill myself just to be fair
I’ll never need another queen
We’ll never face the guillotine

Love is patient, love is kind
Doesn’t poison baby’s wine
Isn’t jealous or provoked
Doesn’t quit or give up hope

Oh-oh-oh, I am not impressed
I love you the best
(Not impressed)
I am not impressed
Just a bunch of losers
A lot of fools
Long list of victims
Oh, not all that cool
We’ve got nothing
To live up to

I am not impressed
Long list of victims

I am not impressed
Long list of victims
