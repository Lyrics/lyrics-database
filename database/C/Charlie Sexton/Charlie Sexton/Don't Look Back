Well, it’s a mixed-up picture
And it’s a shook-up world
It’s full of fallen angels
Angry young men and frightened little girls

Yeah, the clock is ticking
And the danger lurks
And the times have changed
Life’s gotten cheaper, and love usually hurts

(Come on baby)
I don’t give in
Think about some place down the road
Don’t think about where we’ve been

Don’t look back, don’t turn around
Don’t look back, come on, baby, let’s blow this town!
Don’t look back, don’t turn to stone
Don’t look back, we’re pulling out of the dead zone

Now if I was a banker, or if I was a king
Or if I was a genius, maybe I could fix this thing
Now if you grow up fighting, yeah, if you grow up strong
You can have the future, the problem is the future’s gone

The times got tough, and the night’s so dark
Way off in the distance, I can swear, I can see a spark

Don’t look back and don’t turn around
Don’t look back, come on, baby, let’s blow this town!
Don’t look back, don’t turn to stone
Don’t look back, we’re pulling out of the dead zone

And there’s a light on the horizon
I’m a burning wheel
(Come on baby)
They don’t take prisoners, and they don’t make deals

The times got tough, and the night’s so dark
But way off in the distance, I can swear, I can see a spark

Don’t look back and don’t turn around
Don’t look back, come on, baby, let’s blow this town!
Don’t look back, don’t turn to stone
Don’t look back, we’re pulling out of the dead zone

Don’t look back, don’t turn around
Don’t look back, come on, baby, let’s blow this town!
Don’t look back…
