Boy, you put your spell on me
There’s something about you
’Cause even in my sleepless nights
I’m thinking about you

Well, I think it’s magic with you
Oh, I think it’s magic
Yeah, I think it’s magic, ohh
Yeah, I think it’s magic

Just like you

Something’s got me hypnotized
I’m helpless without you
I focus on your magic eyes
And one day it’s better now

Well, I think it’s magic, with you
Oh, I think it’s magic
Yeah, I think it’s magic, with you
Yeah, I think it’s magic

Just like you

Even if far away from you tonight
But I can feel it slip away, out of sight
Even if far away from you tonight
But I can feel it slip away, out of sight

Well, I think it’s magic
Well, I think it’s magic
Yeah, I think it’s magic, with you
Yeah, I think it’s magic

Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
Just like you
