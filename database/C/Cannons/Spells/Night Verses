I stand alone when I’m with you
I’m a tangled, twisted fool
Draw me into your world
Make it all go away

’Cause I’m sinking like a heavy weight
Like a heavy weight
’Cause I’m sinking like a heavy weight
Like a heavy weight

I can’t seem to get you off of my mind
’Cause every time I try, I fall apart

Now you tell me that you’re running in place
But you don’t feel the same
But I do

Sink slow inside this room
And I’m fading out of view
Voices play in my head
In and out of time again

I can’t seem to get you off of my mind
’Cause every time I try, I fall apart

I can’t face the night with you on my mind
’Cause every time I try, I fall apart

Tell me that you feel the way I do
Tell me that you feel the way I do
Tell me that you feel the way I do
Stuck inside a hazy vision of you

Close my eyes and all I see is you
Tell me that you feel the way I do (Tell me that you feel the way I do)
Stuck inside a hazy vision of you (Stuck inside a hazy vision of you)
Close my eyes and all I see is you (Close my eyes and all I see is you)
Tell me that you feel the way I do
