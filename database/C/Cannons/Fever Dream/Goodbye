I’m just looking out the windowsill
The sun is low, the tide is high
Under the red-moon sky
That’s when you said goodbye

And you said
You said, you’d save my soul
You said, you’d set me free
Don’t know what you’ve done to me
But maybe I, maybe I need you tonight

Come back and work it out with me
It’s plain to see
I need you, but do you need me?
Come back and work it out with me
I’m on my knees
I need you, but do you need me?

I’m just looking out the windowsill
The key is lost and so is the high
On that velvet night
That’s when we said goodbye

And there is
There’s nothing left to see
There’s nothing left of me
Don’t know how to let you leave
But maybe I, maybe I’m out of my mind

Come back and work it out with me
It’s plain to see
I need you, but do you need me?
Come back and work it out with me
I’m on my knees
I need you, but do you need me?
