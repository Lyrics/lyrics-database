Hey, why don’t you come around? — I miss you babe
Stay, and lift me up, don’t let me hit the ground
’Cause I’ve been walking past midnight
And I’ve been talking to the moon about you

There’s nothing I can do
I’m falling into the tunnel of you, into the tunnel of you
There’s nothing I can do
I’m falling into the tunnel of you, into the tunnel of you

Cry, I’ll save my tears for when the summer’s dry
Over you, you hurt me most when I am close to you
A thousand storms that rage in my heart
A million more to break our love apart

There’s nothing I can do
I’m falling into the tunnel of you, into the tunnel of you
There’s nothing I can do
I’m falling into the tunnel of you, into the tunnel of you
