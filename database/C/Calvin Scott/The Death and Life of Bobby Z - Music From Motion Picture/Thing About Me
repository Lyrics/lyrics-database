In my mind’s eye I can see
All the things that I could be
With just a blow I throw it out
And that’s a thing about me

Strained in pain, that’s how I live
If I got you good for too long, you know it’s gonna give
Whether I’m time down, whether I'm free,
And that’s a thing about me,

Sometimes there’s a crack in the ceiling
And the sunlight hits the floor
Just about then I start thinking
And it starts to rain once more

Ye-yeah…
