In my mind’s eye I can see
All the things that I could be
With just a blow I throw it out
And that’s a thing about me

Strained in pain, that’s how I live
If it got too good for too long, you know it’s gonna give
Whether I’m tied down, whether I'm free
And that’s a thing about me

Sometimes there’s a crack in the ceiling
And the sunlight hits the floor
Just about then I start thinking
And it starts to rain once more

Ye-ye, yeah…
