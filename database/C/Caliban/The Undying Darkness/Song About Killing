I’m here to kill
I’m here to die
I feel this pain
I have this hate
You teach me to love
You teach me fear
But now you’re getting it all back
And my reasons are just trivial
Try to run away
But believe me

To die this is your fate
This is a song about killing
A love letter just for you,
Let’s make it right
Let’s make it clear
No one wants you here

All I want is to kill
I want you dead
The price is too high
My life’s too short
I’m sick of hunting you
You are my shadow
You are my demon
You have to burn for my joy
I’ll watch you burn
So you better run
Before I’ll watch you burn
Try to run away
But believe me
To die is your fate

This is a song about killing
A love letter just for you
Let’s make it right
Let’s make it clear
No one wants you here
