Room of nowhere
Coldness surrounds me,
I’m filled with fear
In this room of nowhere…

Darkness surrounds me
Tell me where is my soul
I move in the dark
Tell me where is my soul
Well-fed from hatred

Screamings surround me,
Kill or die, (your soul is our desire)
In this room of nowhere…

Darkness surrounds me
Tell me where is my soul
I move in the dark
Tell me where is my soul
Well-fed from hatred

Masters of (the) fire
Teach me your art
In this room of nowhere…

Darkness surrounds me
Tell me where is my soul
I move in the dark
Tell me where is my soul
Well-fed from hatred
