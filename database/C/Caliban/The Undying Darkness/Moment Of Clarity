Moment of clarity
I am willing to suffer,
To bleed-to die for the things i care about
But it's like kissing the lips of my dead love-
Like touching her dead cold white skin

I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to hurt you again
I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to loose you again

I have been here before,ground zero
The past is a gaping hole

My only chance is to turn around and face it
I choose to look back to see myself-
For her love
For her heart
For her trust
For her love i'm reborn…

I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to hurt you again
I choose to look back-
To see myself
I never wanted to loose you again
