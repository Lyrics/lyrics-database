Stand up you’ve got to manage, I wont sympathize anymore.
And if you complain once more, you meet an army of me.
You’re all right, there’s nothing wrong, self sufficiency please!
And get to work.
And if you complain once more, you meet an army of me.
You’re all right, there’s nothing wrong, self sufficiency please!
You’re on your own now, we won’t save you, we won’t save you,
You’re on your own now, we won’t save you, your rescue squad is too exhausted.
And if you complain once more, you meet an army of me.
You’re all right, there’s nothing wrong, self sufficiency please!
