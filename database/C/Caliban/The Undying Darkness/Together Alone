Your life is life, mine is just a lie
Your life is life, mine is just a lie

Time passes by, everything flows
In the same stream
And we are driving down the river,
I pause and let you go,
My tears whip the river,
There I stand stiff forever,
Singing this song of mourning

My cradle is full of hope
I don’t give up,
I break the wall (and fight)
my cradle is full of hope
I don’t give up,
I break the wall (and fight)

You’re going your own way,
Floating in another dream,
You feel no fear, no doubt,
Your power keeps real
There will be new paths,
No doubt and well fed fears,
We will go our ways alone,
Together alone, let’s go

Your life is life, mine is just a lie
Your life is life, mine is just a lie
