In our world fire burns brightly,
Take care or you get hurt,
Flames kiss you goodnight,
In our world you cry.
Ashes is what’s left behind,
You’re dead in my head,
In our world you cry

We’ve gone too far now,
We fell too deep,
It’s our burden to bleed!

We - kill you all!
Kill you all!
We - kill you all!
Kill you!

We’ve gone too far,
We fell to deep,
Didn’t you see?
It’s our burden to bleed.
Our life was just a lie,
Our way just pain what happened,
What’s left behind?

We’ve gone too far now,
We fell too deep,
It’s our burden to bleed!

We - kill you all!
Kill you all!
We - kill you all!
Die!

What’s left behind?
What’s left behind?
What’s left behind?
What is left… behind?
