What is the meaning, which is the drive that keeps on hurting you?
My words are a double-edged sword, my wounds are your scars of tomorrow!
No more 2nd chances, no more fucking chances.
Every step I make is wrong, it’s like a (fuckin) nightmare and there are no more 2nd chances!!
No more 2nd chances, no more fucking chances.
All I can see is a horizon of pain (and hatred),
I just reflected cold emotions and I deserve the pain, maybe I’ll wake up one day!?
No more 2nd chances, no more fucking chances.
