Certainty of emptiness, trustful,
New pain and thoughts of the path
There is just one constant: Nothing is forever!
Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black and white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief,
Nothing is forever!

I gave my heart,
My blood,
Nothing is forever (but eternity).

Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black an d white deceives,
Uncovers the glance for my grief,
Nothing is forever!
And in the end only haze remains,
Nothing is forever.

I gave my heart,
my blood,
nothing is forever (but eternity).

Certainty of fate,
Fatal emptiness,
An empty hope for future,
How shapeless fate shows,
I fight for something eternal,
Time of calm and peace,
Time to look inside,
Relic pictures of past,
Black and white deceives uncovers the glance for my grief.
Nothing is forever!
