You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me (kidding me)
We are, we are one voice - one heart!
We are, we are one voice - one heart!

You sound like a broken record,
Different words for the same old lies
You know we’ll be the ones who suffer,
You gain power while we pay the price
Every time you open your mouth,
You spread a disease
You try to make us voiceless,
You try to make us believe

We are the many,
Like drops of water,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many,
Like a plague of locusts,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing

We are the many!
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many!
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are, we are one voice - one heart!

Any disaster is very welcome
In the darkest days
You promise the sun
Like the savior of a world in debris?
Yeah right,
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me (kidding me)
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me

We are the many,
Like a plague of locusts,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many,
Like a plague of locusts,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing

We are the many!
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many!
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are, we are one voice - one heart!

One voice - one heart!

You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me
You’ve gotta be fucking kidding me

One voice - one heart!

We are the many,
Like drops of water,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many,
Like a plague of locusts,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing

We are the many,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing
We are the many,
Alone we are nothing,
Together we’re crushing

We are, we are one voice - one heart!
One voice - one heart!
One voice - one heart!
