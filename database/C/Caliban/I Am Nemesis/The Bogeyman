The bogeyman is waiting
In the shadows of your dreams
You’re afraid to fall asleep
You’re awake ’til you’re too weak
Come sweetie come it’s bogey time,
let me in and you’ll be mine

This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You’ll never know (know)
This pain
That’s accusing you
My scars don’t even begin to show

This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You’ll never know (know)
This pain
That’s accusing you
My scars don’t even begin to show

Your soul is broken
And can never be mend (never be mend)
You are trapped in a silent cage
Come sweetie, come

Come sweetie come it’s bogey time,
Let me in and you’ll be mine
Run sweetie run, cry and fade,
This will be your last serenade
Run, cry, fight, die

This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You’ll never know (know)
This pain
That’s accusing you
My scars don’t even begin to show

This pain
I bottled up inside
This pain
You’ll never know (know)
This pain
That’s accusing you
My scars don’t even begin to show (begin to show)

Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Penetrates your dreams
Here comes the bogeyman (bogeyman)
Taking white
Giving red
