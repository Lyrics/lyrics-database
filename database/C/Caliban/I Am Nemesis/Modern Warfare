Welcome to war

Everybody knows you and everybody told you
That nobody needs you and nobody cares
Everybody
Is at war with their fingers on the board
What’s real and in your head
You release your poison to the world
This is the modern plague

Welcome to war
You can’t escape

If this is real, I’d rather go blind
Than have this world pulled over my eyes
Cause in the end, it’s all in my mind
And you’re the one who’s left behind

Everybody knows you and everybody told you
That nobody needs you and nobody cares
Everybody
Is caught in a world of make believe
Get a life - this is not real
We allow ourselves to be deceived
A virus, no one could heal

Welcome to war
You can’t escape

If this is real, I’d rather go blind
Than have this world pulled over my eyes
Cause in the end, it’s all in my mind
And you’re the one who’s left behind

If this is real
If this is real

Welcome to war
You can’t escape

If this is real, I’d rather go blind
Than have this world pulled over my eyes
Cause in the end, it’s all in my mind
And you’re the one who’s left behind

FYI
I don’t care if you fucking die
FYI
I don’t care if you fucking die
