Blood for blood
Heart for heart
Woke up in this dream
An ugly world unseen
Unleash the beast in me
Taking a walk on elm street
I sing you a lullaby
In which your fears come to life
A good place to die
No chance to survive

Eye for an eye
A feast of sacrifice
I’m the shadow, I am the light
No place to run, no place to hide
Blood pours from the sky
We’re dancing in the rain
Pandemonium, a symphony in pain

I am your demise
I am your demise
I am your demise
I am your demise
You’re my sacrifice
You’re my sacrifice
You’re my sacrifice
You’re my sacrifice

I am the shadow, I am the light
You’re my sacrifice
I am the shadow, I am the light
I’m your demise

Who I am?
I am you!

Those who enter here
Will forever disappear
In the darkest night
I whispered in your ear
You will be mine
Cause it’s high time
Carnage
Chaos
Endless pain
Will drive you insane

I am nemesis
I give you death
Now you belong to me
Die in agony
Greetings from hell
These are my dying words
Every time I kill
I hope to end this curse

I am the shadow, I am the light
You’re my sacrifice
I am the shadow, I am the light
I’m your demise

Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me
Killing you is killing me

Am I awake or still asleep?
Don’t wake me up, don’t make this real
Am I awake or still asleep?
Don’t wake me up, don’t make this
Don’t make this real
