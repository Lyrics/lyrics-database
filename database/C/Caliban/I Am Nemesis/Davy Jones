I’m not going down that road again
You will drown by yourself again
In your ocean of made up lies
Rising water slowly shuts your eyes

The waves are coming in
They’re washing you away
They’re leading you astray
I can be your anchor no more

I’m not going down that road again
You will drown in the crimson rain
A flooded soul, a cold embrace
Davy Jones’s locker till the end of days

The waves are coming in
They’re washing you away
They’re leading you astray

The waves are coming in
They’re washing you away
They’re leading you astray

I’m so sorry
Cause I’m not sorry
I’m so sorry
Cause I’m not sorry

I’m so sorry
Cause I’m not sorry
I’m not sorry

The waves are coming in
They’re washing you away
They’re leading you astray

The waves are coming in
They’re washing you away
They’re leading you astray

I didn’t see that coming

Get lost
Get the fuck away from me
Get lost
Get the fuck away from me
Get lost
Get the fuck away
Get lost
Get the fuck away
Get lost
Get the fuck away from me
Get lost
Get the fuck away from me
Get lost
Get the fuck away
Get lost
Get the fuck away
