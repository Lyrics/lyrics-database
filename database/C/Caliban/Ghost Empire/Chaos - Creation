A New World Order to decide the chaos,
To daze our minds and to keep us blind

We’re blinded and we followed without rhyme or reason
A government charade - the highest form of treason
We need to burst these Chains of oppression
We need to rise and walk the path of liberation

Right here, right now - light up the freedom flame
Tonight - this is our time
Ignite the fire in your hearts tonight
Right here, right now - wake up and make a change
Tonight - this is our time
Ignite the fire in your hearts tonight

Create a new chaos - and get in motion
With no retreat and no surrender

We need to converage and set the streets on fire
We need to bring down this corrupted empire
Smoke is everywhere - freedom
