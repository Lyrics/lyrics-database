We’re looking back on many years,
Lucky days and little tears
We made mistakes and had some fights,
Blackend days and lonely nights!
But we grow closer, the older we get
Whatever we do - we have no regrets

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars

Can you feel my heart!?

We’re looking forward to many years,
Different cares and different fears
Whatever tomorrow brings, I’ll walk with you
The mistakes we made - we won’t make twice
I tould you then, I tell you now - I will never let you down

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars

Can you feel my heartbeat? - Can you see my heart bleed?

I wanna thank you - for being strong
I wanna thank you - for guiding me home
I wanna thank you - for being bright
I will always hold you - I won’t ever leave you behind

We are far from being perfect, but this is who we are
We will walk this way together, with our hearts right to the stars
