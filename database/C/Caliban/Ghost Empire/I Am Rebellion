I am the dark of the night,
The light of the day and everything in between
I’m nothing - I’m different - Where do I belong?
Why do I hate myself so much - Why can’t I be strong?
I’m a misfit - Won’t fit this - and nobody cares
I’m a stranger to myself - I find it hard to hear
Would you realize when I disappear?
I’m invisible like Neptune’s tears!

No storm will take our breath and blow us away
The earth will shake with every word that we say
When worlds collide - we will always stay!

There’s a stranger inside of me,
So deep inside of me - he will no longer be
I was no one - an empty shell,
A seeker - searching for myself
There is a reason - I am the way I am
I am who I am - I am rebellion!
I’m too different to be a part of you,
But not in different to change the world!

No storm will take our breath and blow us away
The earth will shake with every word that we say
When worlds collide - we will always stay!
