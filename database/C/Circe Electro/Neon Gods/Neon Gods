We listen to the city’s pulse
Its beat is our lullaby
And the stories told
Are as endless as the sky

When the darkness comes
We simply take it all in
As it grows, and grows
We let it under our skin

’Cause the skies light up when the sun goes down
Living high on the night where the street lights groan
We will fly in the face of the blind man’s tone
We will run, we will fight ’til we spark the night

Standing under Neon Gods
Standing under Neon Gods

We live, we die
While the world still sleeps
We hear the lonely cries
Of the underworld’s creep

’Cause the skies light up when the sun goes down
Living high on the night where the street lights groan
We will fly in the face of the blind man’s tone
We will run, we will fight ’til we spark the night

Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)
Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)
Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)
Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)
Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)
Standing under Neon Gods (yeah we’re standing)

Standing under Neon Gods
Standing under Neon Gods
