Opening my eyes
Clouds go floating by

For a while
I see your smile
Just for a while
I go high

For a while
I see your smile
For a while
I go high

Now we fall in sleep
Ever lost, you know

I could cry
In your eyes
I could cry
When we try

I could die
In your smile
I could cry
In your eyes

Makes me happy
I go high
