Wonderful things can happen
Wherever you are
Wonderful things can make you
Reach out for the stars
Walking around, got to keep my eyes open, you see
Walking around gonna keep my mind open, until…

Wonderful things can touch you
And I know they will
Things that will make you happy
And peaceful and still

And what if my eyes were sleeping, and they never saw?
What if I lost my way and I began to fall…
Lose sight of things and all of the dreams that we long for
But all of it’s meant for us, we’ll find a way, for sure

’Cause wonderful can happen wherever we are
Sometimes our thoughts can stop us
This time ...
