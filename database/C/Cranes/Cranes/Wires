You open up your eyes, I open my eyes
And things seem clear
I start to realise the things I need
Are now so near

It’s only when you feel
These moments can be real

I really want to change the way I think
The way that I live
I know I’ve got a lot more stuff inside me
That I can give

Been searching for a way to reach the day
Move in a new mode
Somehow I’ll find the strength to start again
Walk on a new road

It’s all in your hands
It’s all in your heart
It’s all in your hands
It’s all in your heart
