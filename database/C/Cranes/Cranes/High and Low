Out here on this road
I had a feeling that I’d find a meaning
But everything’s moving so slow
I’m caught between to and from
And I’ve still got a long way to go

Here on the pathway I only got half-way
Caught up in the ebb and the flow
My head is reeling, got lost in a feeling
And I don’t know which way to go
Maybe where the winter wind blows?
Or out where the wild river flows

I’ve got a puzzle in my mind
Where’s the place between high and low?
Maybe one day I’ll know
Maybe one day I’ll know
But I’ve still got a long way to go
Still got a long way to go…
Still got a long way to go…
Still got a long way to go…
Still got a long way to go…
Still got a long way to go
