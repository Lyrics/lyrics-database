We’re all as light as feathers
Blowing in the weather
Looking for a place to float
Could hide away forever
But it’s now or never
Take a chance, untie the boat

See the stormy weather
Feel the change of pressure
Watch the seasons come and go
Freedom is a treasure 
That I just can’t measure
All it means is that you are

See the stormy weather
Feel the change of pressure
Watch the seasons come and go
Freedom is a treasure
That I just can’t measure
All it means is that you are
