We had all the time in the world
It seemed like forever, it seemed like forever
In a perfect messed up world
It seemed like forever, it seemed like forever

I guess you’ve told me the way it would be
I didn’t want to believe you, just couldn’t see
I just fall out of my feelings, I was feeling kinda lonely
I just thought you’d want me, but you don’t need me

Things I made out there are here
Hold me together, hold me together
And I think of all the things I’ve said
Our time together seemed like forever, seemed like forever, seemed like forever

I guess you’ve told me the way it would be
I didn’t want to believe you, just couldn’t see
I just fall out of my feelings, I was feeling kinda lonely
Oh, I just thought you’d want me, but you don’t need me

Things I made out there are here
Hold me together, hold me together
And I think of all the things I’ve said
Our time together seemed like forever, seemed like forever, seemed like forever
