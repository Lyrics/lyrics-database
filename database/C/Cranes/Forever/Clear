I look around here as I start to undress
It’s all upside down and I must confess
My head’s going ’round and I sleep less and less
My days are wasting and my life is a mess

Tears on my face, in my eyes, in my hair
I call out your name, but there’s no one there
Nights are cold and the days aren’t sunny
Nothing in the fridge and there’s fuck-all money

Naked and cold and I’m in despair
I’d like to get away but I don’t know where
At least I’ve got a brain and a way to think clear
Use all my resources to get out of here

I look out of the window as the rain pours down
It’s not easy to leave, but I’ve gotta do it now
My head aches a lot and I can hardly see
Oh Lord, I don’t know what’s to become of me

Nights are cold and the days aren’t sunny
Nothing in the fridge and there’s fuck-all money
But at least I’ve got a brain and a way to think clear
Use all my resources to get out of here
