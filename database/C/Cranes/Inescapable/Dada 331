Life is long and filled with warmth & sun
So long as you can can feel it when it comes
Take a look and see what I’ve become
No sense of anything, it’s all gone numb

All around is in a blaze
I’m floating in an empty haze
I look ahead but there’s no way
To stop before it falls away from here

And all this shit, it takes it out of me
Troubles stretch as far as I can see
But I don’t want to get down on my knees…

Life is long and filled with warmth & sun
So longs as you can can feel it when it comes
You can reach your arms out, don’t be numb
I know you will feel and heal as one
