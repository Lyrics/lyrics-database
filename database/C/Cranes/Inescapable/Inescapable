You make believe
Your love is stronger
You make believe me now
The days are longer
You make believe me now
Your love is stronger

Love
Go longer now
Go longer now
Go long

You make believe me now
Your love is stronger
You make believe me now
The days are longer
You’ll never leave me now
Your love is stronger

Love
Go longer now
Go longer now

And I can’t believe me now
And love is stronger
He’ll never believe me now
The days are longer
He’ll never believe me now
Your love is stronger
He’ll never believe me now
The days are longer
