We would go driving in the sun
Into a world where we were one
We’d close our eyes and we’d become
As free as the sun and moon that shone

And even when our love is gone
And time has moved us all along
And even when the shades have passed
And what we made has gone at last

Something goes on and on
And on
On and on and…
On and on and on

Though I know that things
Won’t change
I remember all our days
Beautiful in many ways

Guess I was searching for someone
I guess I thought you were the one
’Cos I so wanted to belong
But now I know that I was wrong

But I believe that there was love
That fell between the two of us
And I believe the time we had
Was meant to be but not to last

Though I know that things
Won’t change
I remember all our days
Beautiful in many ways
