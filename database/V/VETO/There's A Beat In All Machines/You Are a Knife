We’ve got till the break of dawn
We have to just carry on
We’ve got till the sun comes up
Keep up the speed and never stop

You’ve got your guns and war machines
You’re like a knife, you cut things clean
There’s no one here to end this war
No one knows what you wage it for

You walk and walk proud
Elbows out
You will never stop
nor give up
Drive and drive fast
You will never stop
The road was paved for you

You got your guns and war machines
You’re like a knife you cut things clean
But there’s a beat in all machines
And a song in everything

You walk and walk proud
Elbows out
You will never stop
nor give up
Drive and drive fast
You will never stop
The road was paved for you
