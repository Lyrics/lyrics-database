I was giving you
Some kind of a present.
I was giving you
’though your more than I discern.
And I was put in to give you
Everything that you need.
But instead I do
Whatever it is I please.

And I was built to give you
More than I do now.
And I was built to show you
More than I do now.
And I was put in to give you
The world on a platter.
But instead I just sit here
And do nothing that really matters.

And I was built to give you
More than I do now.
And I was built to show you
More than I do now.
And I was put in to give you
The world on a platter.
But instead I just sit here
And do nothing that really matters.

You lift me up from
The world of falling.

You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
You kept me going and this is how I thank you.
