Duck tape that mechanical eye
When it’s blind it can’t tell whether truth is a lie
Used a sewer ’cause the street’s are not safe
And don’t tell anyone that you’re tryin’ to escape
And don’t make a sound while you are runnin’ away
’cause desertion is not looked upon mildly these days

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
Do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with this place

And we can leave if that’s what it takes
To make us feel good, to make us feel safe
But maybe runnin’ is the easy way out
We could fight for the right ways, fight for our birthplace
And we should not let these people forget what they’ve done
’cause they fed us lies and made us fear everyone

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
But do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with this place

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
But do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with yourself

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
But do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with this place

Duck for the camera lens
Hush for the microphone
But do whatever you can where you are
To change all the things that are wrong with yourself
