Hey, he’s got me looking quite beige
Got me deep in the haze
There’s no more compassion, no
Raise me, I need something fast
I need something to last
And give satisfaction, oh

Help me, grab his right arm
Help me, I’ll take the left
Oh help me, help me
Interrogate him!

How big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Oh, can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave

How big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Oh, can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave

Hey, all this fake news, tell me
What is the use, tell me
There’s no more compassion, no
Please find me, under these layers
Among these taxpayers
There’s no satisfaction, no

I said, help me, help myself
Oh get me, down from this shelf
Oh help me, help me
Dislocate

How big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Oh, can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave
Now, how big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave

Hold on, he will break and you and me
We will go there
Have no fear
My dear

How big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Oh, can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave

How big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience
Oh, can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave

Now, how big is your love?
Tell me, how high is your patience?
Can I be saved?
I wanna catch the wave
