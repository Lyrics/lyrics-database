Expecting some love
Expecting some…

I’m tired to see the blood on the floor

Energy is low
I had no chance I had to kill ’em all
Kill ’em all yes, yeah.

Every bullet that I’ve shot

My life is not like yours
It’s the same different world.

Every bullet that I’ve shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

Every bullet that I’ve shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

Every bullet that I’ve shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
It’s the same different world.

Every bullet that I’ve shot
Was for every tear I dropped
My life is not like yours
We are on a same different world.

We are on a same different world…

We are on a same different world…
