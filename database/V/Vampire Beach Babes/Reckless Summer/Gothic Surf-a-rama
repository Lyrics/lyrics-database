I once knew a girl
She was smart and she was pretty
She rocked her way from sweet L.A
All the way down in New York City
She’s looking for a scene
For getting out of hand
Now she’s found a little something
And she’s checking out the band

From the northern Arctic Circle
Down to southern Alabama
Everybody’s doing
The gothic surf-a-rama

Hang onto your panties
Go and get out your board
Go and get down on your knees
And start praying to your Lord
There is something cooking for you
That you may not understand
Don’t go crying to your daddy
Don’t get mom to hold your hand

From the northern Arctic Circle
Down to southern Alabama
Everybody’s doing
The gothic surf-a-rama

Don’t get hung up on the tootsie
Don’t get hung up on the twist
V.B.B. has got the rhythm
That you just can’t resist
And that girl that I had mentioned
Well, now she’s just doing fine
And I heard it from her friend
She surf-a-ramas all the time

From northern Arctic Circle
Down to southern Alabama
Vampire Beach Babes
Do the gothic surf-a-rama

From northern Arctic Circle
Down to southern Alabama
Everybody’s doing
The gothic surf-a-rama
