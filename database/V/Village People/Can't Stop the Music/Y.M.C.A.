Young man, there’s no need to feel down
I said, young man, pick yourself off the ground
I said, young man, ’cause you’re in a new town
There’s no need to be unhappy
Young man, there’s a place you can go
I said, young man, when you’re short on your dough
You can stay there, and I’m sure you will find
Many ways to have a good time

It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man, are you listening to me?
I said, young man, what do you wanna be?
I said, young man, you can make real your dreams
But you got to know this one thing
No man does it all by himself
I said, young man, put your pride on the shelf
And just go there, to the Y.M.C.A.
I’m sure they can help you today

It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
You can get yourself clean, you can have a good meal
You can do whatever you feel

Young man, I was once in your shoes
I said, I was down and out with the blues
I felt no man cared if I were alive
I felt the whole world was so jive
That’s when someone came up to me
And said, “Young man, take a walk up the street
It’s a place there called the Y.M.C.A.
They can start you back on your way”

It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
They have everything for young men to enjoy
You can hang out with all the boys
Y.M.C.A.… It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
Young man, young man, there’s no need to feel down
Young man, young man, get yourself off the ground

Y.M.C.A.… It’s fun to stay at the Y.M.C.A.
Young man, young man, are you listening to me?
Young man, young man, what do you wanna be?
Y.M.C.A.… you’ll find it at the Y.M.C.A.
No man, no man does it all by himself
Young man, young man, put your pride on the shelf
Y.M.C.A.… and just go to the Y.M.C.A.
Young man, young man I was once in your shoes
Young man, young I was down with the blues
Y.M.C.A.…
