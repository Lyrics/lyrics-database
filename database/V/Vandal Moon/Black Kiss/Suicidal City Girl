I love her
I love her madly
I want her
I need her badly

I never wanted to be free
I never wanted to be free

You are my nighttime city girl
Forever hiding city girl
My suicidal city girl
You are my downtown city girl
All dressed to kill me city girl
My homicidal city girl

I watch her
I feel her grieving
I hold her
I see her dreaming

I never wanted to be free
I never wanted to be free

You are my nighttime city girl
Forever hiding city girl
My suicidal city girl
You are my downtown city girl
All dressed to kill me city girl
My homicidal city girl

You are my nighttime city girl
Forever hiding city girl
My suicidal city girl
You are my downtown city girl
All dressed to kill me city girl
My homicidal city girl
