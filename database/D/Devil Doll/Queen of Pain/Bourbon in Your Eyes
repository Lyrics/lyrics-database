Call me angel and take my hand
Wishing you could be my man
But I can tell if it’s truth or lies
When you’ve got bourbon in your eyes

Tell me something that I don’t know
Then I dare you to prove it so
I’d ask you to try this on for size
But you’ve got bourbon in your eyes

You’re so… mmm

I find myself showing up at your front door
Although I can’t come in, I keep coming back for more
And when you call me baby, it feels just like a line
And every time you smile when you look into my eyes
You don’t have the guts to love me like you wish you could
I’m gonna find someone to make me feel the way I should

Run your fingers through my hair
I want you to touch me there
But I will not open up my thighs
When you’ve got bourbon in your eyes

You’re the one that makes me smile
And I know you’d make it worth my while
But she’s waiting for you, and I think she cries
When you’ve got bourbon in your eyes

You’re so… mmm

I find myself showing up at your front door
Although I can’t come in, I keep coming back for more
And when you call me baby, it feels just like a line
And every time you smile when you look into my eyes
You don’t have the guts to love me like you wish you could
I’m gonna find someone to make me feel the way I should

You’re so sweet-talking
You’re so fire-walking
I know I shouldn’t, but I want some
Little boy, you’re lost
I see you lookin around
But I think that you know more than you let on…

I must leave you, ’cause I know your kind
You’d wake me up just to say goodbye
And I know that’s not a tear in your eye
’Cause boys don’t cry, and neither do I

I may be in love, but I’ll never say
So I guess I’ll be on my way
At least I gave it a try
But you had bourbon in your eyes
