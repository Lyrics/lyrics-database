You life’s been balanced on a razor blade
But now you’ve got a bloody nose
Tell me you want out of all you know
And push all away all that you love
Too many promises, too many chances
I’ve heard all your tales before
Talk about me like we’re best friends
But I don’t know who you really are

You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn

The fear’s been hidden but it’s on its way
You know that it will get you soon
Tearing you apart as you cross the line
You know that there’s nowhere to hide
Take back your promises, take back your chances
I’ve seen all your tricks before
Making a mistake, you do it wrong
And I don’t know who you really are

You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn
You know you do it wrong
The time will come to feel the freezer burn

To feel the freezer burn
