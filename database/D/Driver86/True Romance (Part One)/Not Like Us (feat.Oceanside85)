Now you and I can celebrate
all the days we’ve had
why you were there
I don’t even want to understand

I love the way you walk
I knew right from the start
that you were the only one
that could fit this puzzle

Look what you’ve done to me
I’m a wreck on the floor
Look what you made me feel
I want you so much more

Even when I’m all alone
I feel okay
’cause I know you’re out there
breathing the air somewhere

Look what you’ve done to me
I’m already gone
you had me at hello
that was your cheesy come-on

When you told me you were afraid
that’s when I knew
That you had been broken
Quite a few times

And I promised
and I’ll keep my promise
I won’t faulter
Believe it!

I need you like I need a fresh breath of air
I want you like I want the beating in my chest
and I see that one day it will fall away
’cause it’s natural in this world we live

But oh, universe, let me live this love again
Let me live this love again
Let me live this love again
Let me live this love again

Again!
