Put my trust in you my love defended you
Dispite our past I still breathe for you
The sign is chosen for destiny
And this is all I see.

Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down anywhere I hide
All I was had now in tears I drown.

You made my beliefs grow a little stronger
I’m a dead end can’t feel it no longer
When I dream I am still awake
And this is what I see.

Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down anywhere I hide
All I once had now in tears I drown.

Leaves fall down
One by one
Leaves falling down
In tears I drown
Leaves fall down
One by one
Leaves falling down
In tears I drown

Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
its falling to pieces
All I once had now in tears I drown
Leaves falling down falling side by side
All I predicted has now begun
Leaves falling down anywhere I hide
All I once had now in tears I drown.
