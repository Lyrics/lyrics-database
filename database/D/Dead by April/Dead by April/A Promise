You only saw the dark side of me
Bring me back to my reality
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

I have lost the will to fly
With broken wings I can’t even try
I have lost my belief

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay

Picture a world for us
A promise to set me free
Imagine a place for us
A promise will set me free
(Picture a world for us)
(A promise to set me free)

(A promise)

Without you, I fail in every way
Picture a world for me, where I can stay
Without you, I break in every way
Imagine a place for us, where you and I stay
