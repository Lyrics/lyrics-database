So there you are
Alone, with those a blazing eyes like an angel brought to life
You have my destiny

I’m free, you are my saviour
I’m free, you are my guiding soul
All I need is you

I tried to fight for so many years I’ve tried
You brought me back to life changed my world guided me

I’m free, you are my saviour
I’m free, you are my guiding soul
All I need is you (I am free)

I’m free, you are (you are) my saviour (my saviour)
I’m free, you are (you are) my guiding soul
All I need (all I need) is you ’is you)
