Oh

My life was brought into a nightmare
Dark shadows surrounded me
Five times the pain of torture
It buried deep within me
It makes me shiver down my spine
To even think of it
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I’m finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

I’m going insane it feels like I am lost
The panic, the fear, the mind tricks is haunting me
Is this my destiny?
Talk to me
What is the reason?
I’m finished
Answer me
Completely blinded by agony

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

Leaving our tears behind
Angels of clarity
Show me the way
Leaving my past behind
Angels of clarity
Show me the way
Angels of clarity

Save me from myself

Save me
Falling down
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety

Save me
Falling down (falling down)
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Save me
Frozen inside (falling down)
Angels of clarity
I am dead by anxiety
Dead by anxiety
