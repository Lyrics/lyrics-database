(Yeah)
(Yeah)

With you the grass is always greener
And the tears are left behind
There no one can take my freedom
And my heart isn’t next in line
With you the sun is always rising
When I’m with you it’s never dark
With you the clouds are free from rain and
With you my life doesn’t fall apart, yeah

I miss you more than ever, more than I can put to words
Every day it’s getting harder to leave it all behind
I am missing you more than yesterday
I am missing you

(Yeah)

We’ll live a life filled with melodies
Now the stories is my dear friend
A rich life free from promises
I try to smile but I cant pretend, no

I miss you more than ever, more than I can put to words
Every day it’s getting harder to leave it all behind
I am missing you, more than yesterday
I am missing you, more than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday, yesterday, yesterday

The surface cracks, getting larger than yesterday
As I am moving further from yesterday
Can see the end now, it’s closer than yesterday
As I am moving further from yesterday

Yesterday, yesterday, yesterday
More than yesterday

I miss you more than ever, more than I can put to words
Every day it’s getting harder to leave it all behind
I am missing you, more than yesterday
I am missing you, more than yesterday (Yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday), yesterday
More than yesterday (Yesterday)
Yesterday (yesterday), yesterday, oh
