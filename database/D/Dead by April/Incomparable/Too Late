I’ve been running all night long
And the pulse is pounding in my chest
Now I am here, there are feelings that I just must express

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late

Gotta get this outta my system
I’ve gathered my strength, ripped my blindfold off
I’m ready now, I have stayed in the dark with my mind switched off

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late
Open for me, cannot wait out here anymore
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late

I don’t wanna be out here on my own
I don’t wanna be outside in the cold
I don’t wanna be completely alone
I just wanna be right where I belong

Ergh!

Open for me
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late

Open for me, I am standing outside your door
Whatever you say, don’t say it’s too late
(Open for me) Cannot wait out here anymore
(Whatever you say) Don’t say it’s too late
