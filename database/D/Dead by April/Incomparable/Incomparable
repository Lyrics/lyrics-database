I would carry the world
I would stand here and burn

You are incomparable
You are irresistible
You are incomparable
You are unmistakable

I would catch if you fall
I’d take a spear through my heart

You are incomparable
You are irresistible
You are incomparable
You are unmistakable

No hurricane can move me, earthquakes can’t shake me
I will always stand my ground, always be around
No snowstorm can freeze me, black holes can’t take me
I will always stand my ground, always be around

You are incomparable
You are irresistible
You are incomparable
Incomparable, unmistakable

No hurricane can move me, earthquakes can’t shake me
I will always stand my ground, always be around
No snowstorm can freeze me, black holes can’t take me
I will always stand my ground, always be around
