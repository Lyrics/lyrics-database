There are things that I need to say
To hear me, please don’t take this the wrong way, hey
I don’t wanna make things harder, no, I don’t wanna complicate
This is keeping me awake

(Yeah) Standing at the crossroads now and we can’t back down
’Cause there’s nothing left worth saving there (Yeah)
We need to close that door, we’ve been here before
Now there’s nothing left worth saving there

I hear you, maybe we’re not indestructible
I know that we can be more if we let it go
I know that we can be so much better, girl
If we make the right choice now
We don’t need to look back

(Yeah) Standing at the crossroads now and we can’t back down
’Cause there’s nothing left worth saving there (Yeah)
We need to close that door, we’ve been here before
Now there’s nothing left worth saving there

’Cause you’re breaking me, shaking me
You’re taking me over
We were love drunk and we shine
We need to get sober
Before we fall over

Standing at the crossroads now and we can’t back down
’Cause there’s nothing left worth saving there

Standing at the crossroads now and we can’t back down
’Cause there’s nothing left worth saving there (Yeah)
We need to close that door, we’ve been here before
Now there’s nothing left worth saving there
