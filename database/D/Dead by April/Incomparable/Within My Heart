You remember me, you remember us
It was magical when I felt your touch
It’s a strong memory still today
It feels so good with your body close
Those days are gone, time flies away
But it’s what I’m dreaming of still today

I’m sad to see that this was all we had
But within my heart, you’ll have a place deep within my heart
A special place for you no matter what was said and done
Within my heart, you’ll always be inside my heart as long as I live

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Within my heart

What once was strong and filled with passion
Has withered away and turned to nothing
But you’re all I’m dreaming of still today

It’s sad that what we had is dead and gone
But within my heart, you’ll have a place within my heart
A special place forever, no matter what happened
You have a place in my heart, within my heart for eternity

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
(Within my heart, within my heart)
Within my heart, within my heart

Every night I have this dream
Will I find the right way back again into your open arms?
Every night you’re in my dreams
And I know that we will meet again
It’s written in the stars and within my heart

Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us
Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us
I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go
Within my heart, within my heart
Within my heart, within my heart
