You are pushing my patience, lied to and used
I’m sick and tired of being denied and refused

Hurting me (Hurting me)
Breaking me (Breaking me)
Hurting me (Hurting me)
Burning me

’Cause what you see is real and true
You can’t take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can’t take that away from me
Won’t let it slip away, it means too much to me
’Cause what you see is real and true

I will not let you break down what I’ve built up
I will do whatever it takes to make this stop

Hurting me (Hurting me)
Breaking me (Breaking me)
Hurting me (Hurting me)
Burning me (I won’t let it go)

’Cause what you see is real and true
You can’t take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can’t take that away from me
Won’t let it slip away, it means too much to me
’Cause what you see is real and true

You see things from a different point of view
Why should I listen, why should I let you in?
(Why should I even trust you?)
We are like two different worlds apart
Won’t let you in on what is rightfully mine
(Why should I even trust you?)

Hurting me (Hurting me)
Breaking me (Breaking me)
Hurting me (Hurting me)
Burning me (I won’t let it go)

’Cause what you see is real and true
You can’t take that away from me
No matter what you do
You can’t take that away from me
Won’t let it slip away, it means too much to me
’Cause what you see is real and true

Real and true
