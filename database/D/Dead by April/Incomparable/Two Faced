Don’t try to help, we’re alone in this war
All efforts will be futile, progressing bit by bit as I’m fighting to kill it
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I’m bleeding

Evil’s on my left, good is on my right
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced

For once, listen to me, now I am crying it out
Tired of hiding it inside, now I am screaming it out
Replace all my frustration with new inspiration, watch me climb
Fighting this addiction, I’m bleeding

Evil’s on my left, good is on my right
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced

I am trying to figure me out, why I’m bleeding
No one will ever understand me; it’s like I’m two faced
Understand me; it’s like I’m two faced
Understand me

Evil’s on my left, good is on my right
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced

Evil’s on my left, good is on my right
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced
Telling me to hate, telling me to smile
It’s like I’m two faced, it’s like I’m two faced
