As I’m waking up blind, I am trapped in a mindfall
So much regret, so much feelings
Are passing through my mind, it feels like my whole existence
Is about to end

I’m lost in time, it feels like I’m fading
(All that’s left is my fate)
I’m lost within, I’m trapped inside of me
(My past is staring at me)

I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away

I feel so harmed, so much left to say
Abuse my life, my fate

It feels like I’m buried down into a black hole
The dust is choking me, what if there’s no tomorrow?
Will I be dead? All these questions
I fall into my end

I’m lost in time, it feels like I’m fading
(All that’s left is my fate)
I’m lost within, I’m trapped inside of me
(My past is staring at me)

I am lost, so far away
I am lost, so far away

I feel so harmed, so much left to say
Abuse my life, my fate

Lost in time, feels like I’m fading
(All that’s left is my fate)
I’m lost within, I’m trapped inside of me
(My past is staring at me)

I am lost (I am lost)
So far away
I am lost (I am lost)
So far away

(My mind cries, lost)
I am lost (I am lost)
So far away
I am lost (I am lost)
So far away

I feel so harmed, so much left to say
Abuse my life, my fate
