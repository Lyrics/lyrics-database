I
was a punk
before you were a punk,
before they were punks,
no one else…

I burned houses,
before you burned houses,
before they burned houses,
no one else…

I destroyes Atlantis
during chaos days
I destroyes Atlantis
I salute the waves…

I was drunken,
before you were drunken
before they were drunken
no one else…

I did parties,
before you did parties,
before they did paries,
no one else…
