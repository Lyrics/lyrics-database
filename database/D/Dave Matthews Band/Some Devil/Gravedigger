Cyrus Jones
1810–1913
Made his great granchildren believe
You could live to a hundred and three
A hundred and three is forever when you’re just a little kid
So Cyrus Jones lived forever

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger…

Muriel Stonewall
1903–1954
She lost both of her babies in the second great war
Now, you should never have to watch
As your only children are lowered in the ground
I mean, never have to bury your own babies

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger…

Ring-a-round the Rosie
A pocket full of posies
Ashes to ashes
We all fall down

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger…

Little Mikey Carson
’67–’75
He rode his bike like the devil
Until the day he died
When he grows up he wants to be
Mister Vertigo on the flying trapeze

Oh, 1940–1992…

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain
I can feel the rain
I can feel the rain

Gravedigger, when you dig my grave
Could you make it shallow
So that I can feel the rain?
Gravedigger…

Gravedigger…
