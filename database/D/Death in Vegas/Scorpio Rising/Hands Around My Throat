Back down and touch, the door is shut
In the end you’re just too close
There’s no one here, there’s no one there
I still can’t tell, and if you’d better try this

And you might find
I’m in your place, I see your face
The air is cold, I’m still on hold
I still can’t tell what’s been said

Your hands around my throat
Ask me to let go
Your hands around my throat
Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat

Your hands around my throat
