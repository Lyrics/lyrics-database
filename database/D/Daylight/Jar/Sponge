I left my head at home,
Buried in the backyard with the dog.
I've thought of leaving more times than once.
I'm leaving you all alone.
I tried so hard to be the rock,
But all I felt like was a wet sponge.

I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man
I'm on a road
I'm not proud of the things I have done
Don't let my living bring you down
You'll never know how much it hurts
To nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown

I'm under a spell.
This isn't what I want for us.
We've held it all together this long.
My spines deep as well.
My heart is bigger than you know.
This family is just a sad song
I want to run, I just can't.
The things it takes to be a man.

I'm on a road.
I'm not proud of the things I have done.
Don't let my living bring you down.
You'll never know how much it
Hurts to nod when I'm the son
I'll never stand and watch you drown
