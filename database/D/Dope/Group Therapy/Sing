Some people sing for life, some people sing for death
Some people sing to sing the songs that they like best
Some people sing for broke, some people sing for fame
Some people sing for hope, some people sing for pain

So when you feel like this and really wish
That everyone else would just go away
When you feel like this and really wish
That everyone else would just go away

(Free your mind and…)

Sing for the man on the corner
Sing for your love of God
Sing for your apathy
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Sing just a little bit louder
Sing with all you’ve got
Sing along with me
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Some people sing for love, some people sing for hate
Some people sing to sing a song ’cause they relate
Some people sing inside, some people sing in vain
Some people sing to lose, some people sing to gain

So when you feel like this and really wish
That everything else would just go away
When you feel like this and really wish
That everything else would just go away

(Open your mind and…)

Sing for the man on the corner
Sing for your love of God
Sing for your apathy
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Sing just a little bit louder
Sing with all you’ve got
Sing along with me, yea-yeah
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Oh, yeah
What you believe
Oh, yeah
What do you believe?

So when you feel like this and really wish
That everything else would just go away
When you feel like this and really wish
That everything else would just go away

Some people sing for life, some people sing for death
Some people sing to sing the songs that they like best
Some people sing for hope, some people sing for pain…

So let me hear you people

Sing for the man on the corner
Sing for your love of God
Sing for your apathy, yea-yea
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Sing just a little bit louder
Sing with all you got
Sing along with me, yea-yea
(No matter, no matter) what you believe

Sing for the man on the corner
Sing for your love of God
Sing for your apathy
(No matter, no matter) what you believe
