Another day goes by
And I don’t understand or know the reasons why
I’m looking for a change in life
But another day goes by

(Here we go again…)

It’s today (it’s today)
I wish it was tomorrow, though I think I’d say (though I think I’d say)
You know, I think it feels just like yesterday
So lately I’ve been looking for a change
But the more things change
The more they seem to stay the same

(Here we go again…)

Another day goes by
And I don’t understand or know the reasons why
I’m looking for a change in life
But another day goes by

(Here we go again…)

It’s a new day (a new day)
It’s almost like tomorrow never came
Same old thing, same old game (different name)
And everyday I sing the same old song
And today I don’t feel like waking up
But the show must go on, and on, and on…

Another day goes by (another day goes by)
And I don’t understand and I don’t pretend to try (don’t pretend to try)
I wanna change my life
But another day goes by

Just when I get it right
Another day goes by

(Here we go again…)

If I could change it
Or rearrange it
Tomorrow could be
Alright

So many days gone by
I still don’t understand, but now I realize
I’m gonna change my life — that’s right
While the days go by

I’m gonna change my life — that’s right
While the days go by, ye-ye
I wanna change my life (change my life)
But another day go by

It’s just another day…
