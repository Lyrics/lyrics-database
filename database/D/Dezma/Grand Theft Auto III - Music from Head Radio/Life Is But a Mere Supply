(Life is but, a mere supply)

I said to Ball: "8-Ball, pop the cop off of Liberty City"
Crazy how the sweets just turn to stone
Get a gun, get a job, get a girl that looks pretty
And I bet she’ll know that I

Full of should, full of do
Full of wishin’ and I’ll love to get it on
Full of hate (watch it!), full of hope
Who’s your daddy?
It’s an ending road

Life is but, a mere supply of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh)
Life is but, a mere supply (supply) of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh) (Oooh-oooh-oooh)

I like it when you burn through the bones
I like it when you talk to the phones
I like it when you say what you own
I like it when you talk to my bone

I like it when you burn through the bones
I like it when you talk to the phones
I like it when you say what you own
I like it when you talk to my bone

Full of should, full of do
Full of wishin’ and I’ll love to get it on
Full of hate (watch it!), full of hope
Who’s your daddy?
It’s an ending road

Life is but, a mere supply of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh)
Life is but, a mere supply (supply) of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh) (Oooh-oooh-oooh)

Life is but, a mere supply (supply) of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh)
Life is but, a mere supply (supply) of a few good thoughts, then you die
(Uh-uh-uh)
