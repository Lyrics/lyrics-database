White sheets run red
Red sheets burn white
This is not your bed
So very far from home again

Dirty river water runs all the way to your room
The water carries memories
Let them guide you

Take a breath and make your way back down
Against the stream

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Draw the map a circling spiral down
Destination your middle name
Momentum saved
Now just wait

Soak this in river water

You might be asleep or you might be awake
It doesn’t matter now
Dirty river water holds the waste that you make
It doesn’t matter now

Upstream against the knives of cold
Will time destroy the weight of what we know?

Now just wait

Your white sheets run red

You haven’t heard a word of what I’ve said
You can’t drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven’t heard a word of what I’ve said
You can’t drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

And this is not your bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven’t heard a word of what I’ve said
You can’t drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven’t heard a word of what I’ve said
You can’t drown in a dry river bed
Your white sheets run red

You haven’t heard a word of what I’ve said
And this is not your bed

Your white sheets run red
