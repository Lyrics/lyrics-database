It's not me in the reflection
Just a phantom in the glass

You still believe what you see
Your obsession
Reflection
Concession
Aggression
Your reflection
And you believe what you see in the prism
Who would you be?
A phantom in the glass
Holding on to me

And you only believe what you can see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
See what you fear to be

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Show me what you want to be
Seeing what you want to see

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
Show me what you want to be

Your obsession
With the reflection
Is a concession
To our regression

Obsession
It's your concession
In the reflection

A prism holding energy
A phantom in the glass now
A prisoner of memory
Seeing what you want to see
Show me who you want to be

Reflection
A phantom of memory
