Selecting the pictures, scrapbook full
Collected memory, the past preserved, history learned
I know what I want and I'm waiting
I know what I need I'm not playing
You're easier said than done
It's easy to make that choice alone
We'll never know whose won

I want to carve my name in her noise
Find comfort in these childhood toys
I want to be dirty and clean at the same time

I never thought it'd be so easy to cut through me
No matter what you do it's too easy to cut through you
It's too easy to cut through you
