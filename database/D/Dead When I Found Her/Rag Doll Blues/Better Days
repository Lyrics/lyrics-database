Crazy weather
Too near the eye of the storm
The ice that cracks our walls
Our tiny shelter from the cold

We raise the curtain for endless rain
A tricky thought stuck in back of your brain
Slippery the cradle, water that burns
Silent the hour, waiting our turn

Our bodies our changing beneath the touch of the rain
We'll build a new constellation
We'll save ourselves for better days

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole

How hollow heart
Cracks the walls around me
Out of the eye of the storm
Endless the rain
Endless the rain

These are the rules
Learn to play
And what you take from here
No price can pay

You'll play for me now
Play for some kind of control
It makes us whole
Study the lines
Learn your part
You'll play for me
Play for some kind of control

Left outside
The frost leaves its mark
Saved, safe
In the dark

Play for me
Play that on my grave now
You'll play for me
Play from the eye of the storm

We ran for shelter when everything changed
We made a promise to keep things the same
Play for me
Play for some kind of control
It keeps us whole
