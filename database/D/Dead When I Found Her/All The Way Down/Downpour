[And the angels wouldn’t help you. Because they’ve all gone away.]

(Desperate to win)
(You are alone now)
(But you need them)
(To face the end)

(Desperate to win)
(You are alone now)
(But you need them)
(To face the end)

(Sleep alone)
Waiting for the first light
(Dream alone)
Running through the white night
(Wake alone)
In an unfamiliar room
(Talk alone)
But the walls here aren’t listening
(Sleep alone)
Praying it’s the last night
(Dream alone)
Burning out the last light
(When they come) the fear’s in their eyes
But there’s no surprise left for you

There’s no surprise left for you

(Desperate to win)
(You are alone now)
(But you need them)
(To face the end)

(Desperate to win)
So desperate to win
(You are alone now)
You are alone now
(But you need them)
You need them
(To face the end)
To face the end

So desperate to win
You wait for the end
For your downpour cloud
To drown you out

So desperate to win
While you wait for the end
For your downpour cloud
To drown you out

Daybreak, headache,
Afternoon stares.
Nightfall, no sleep,
No time to repair.

Daybreak, headache,
Afternoon stares.
Nightfall, no sleep,
Time takes its share.

(Desperate to win)
(You are alone now)
(But you need them)
(Before you)

(Desperate to win)
So desperate to win
(You are alone now)
You are alone now
(But you need them)
You need them
(To face the end)
To face the end

[And the angels wouldn’t help you. Because they’ve all gone away.]
