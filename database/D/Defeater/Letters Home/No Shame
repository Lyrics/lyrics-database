Another day when the sun ain’t shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

To my demons
To every dying wish I’ve had of us leaving
This old ghost town
Still dragging us down
To pull you out of this hell you’ve been living in
With the needle
And every dying wish I’ve had that you would clean up
Your ups and let downs pulling me underground
With every tired lie you tell just to fill your arm

You thin your veins with the dirt
With the hurt
With the memories and the pain

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

And I lost my faith in your god
In your word
In every promise that you break

Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

So I walk the same way home each night
To find that back-alley pusher and take his life
And I ain’t ashamed for what I’ve done
I’ll take an eye for an eye until every junkie is blind
The river bed holds the blood and the knife

And I ain’t ashamed for what I’ve done
I took his eye as a prize
The man who laid with my wife
Lays at the bottom of that river where the sun never shines

Another day when the sun ain’t shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on

Still holding on

Another day when the sun ain’t shining
Another night with the bottle I drown in
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on
Still holding on
Still hoping, still waiting
Still breathing by a thread, still holding on
