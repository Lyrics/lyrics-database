I quit believing in heaven
I found no savior in nothing
I gave away my faith
When I gave my brother a coffin

He was the air in my lungs
He was the blood in my veins
The reason I joined up
The man that I’ll never be

A cigarette and a drink
To burn away my night
And keep the ache in my chest
And his candle burning bright

These words they fall on deaf ears
There is only guilt, death and grief
Your god forgot about us
He’s just a thief and a cheat

A cigarette and a drink
To burn away my night
And keep the ache in my chest
And his candle burning bright

He was the air in my lungs
(He was the air in my lungs)
The man I will never be

He was the blood in my veins

I quit believing in heaven
I found no savior in nothing
I gave away my faith
When I gave my brother a coffin

Let me be damned
