I’ve got this hope in my chest
I’ll see one more sunrise
I’ve got my brother’s good luck
Around my neck every night

I’ve got  this song in my head
It’s got me thinking of him
My hear is heavy with guilt
It’s got my blood running thin

We hold fast, dead set
Hold fast, dead set
The only friends I count as mine

We hold fast, dead set
Hold fast, dead set
Are those who would die to save your life

I’ve got this burning in my gut
I’ve got these words that I write
So if I don’t make it home

They’ll know they were always on my mind
They’ll know

We hold fast, dead set
Hold fast, dead set
The only friends I count as mine

We hold fast, dead set
Hold fast, dead set
Are those who would die to save your life

We hold fast, dead set
Hold fast, dead set
