As the waves crash, the clouds roll.

Sit on the dock waiting for the sun.
Wait for the coward but he never comes.
Pray for revenge on him.
Steam rises as the boats come in,
One by one (one by one).

You know she is gone,
You know there’s no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.

When you come home to find her lying on the floor,
You’re reminded of those sleepless nights
That will haunt you for the rest of your life.
Blue collar shipyard, any way to keep her alive.
Sun up to sun down,
Blistered hands and a parched mouth.

You know she is gone,
You know there’s no saving her.
You know she is gone, you know.
Her cheating, her weak will, the addiction, that needle.
