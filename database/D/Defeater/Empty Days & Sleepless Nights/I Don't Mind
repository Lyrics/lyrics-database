Let’s talk about the old days
Let’s talk about your friends
Let’s talk about the summer
And how you wish it wouldn’t end

Did I forget to tell you
How pretty you looked in that dress?
In the first time that I saw you
You cleaned the mess from my head

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
No, I don’t mind

Lets go walkin’ on the boardwalk
Dip our feet into the sea
Lets find ourselves lost for hours
Until we find ourselves a drink

Lets talk that sun into setting
Just need the sound of your voice
Need that calming and the comfort
Something to drown out the noise

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
’Cause I’m all yours
If you’re all mine

Something I’ve been meanin’ to tell you
About three years and a day
I’d very much like to get married
Maybe have kids and move away

’Cause there ain’t nothing like your smile
Your legs and those eyes
I will beg and steal and borrow
To keep you safe your whole life

And I don’t mind
If we take our time
’Cause I’m all yours
If you’re all mine
