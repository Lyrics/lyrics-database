The way she looked at you, tears streaming down her face.
You felt the brush of her dress as she walked away.

And that’s all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that’s the way that it’s been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Another night at the Copper Coin.
Another night, another night.

And that’s all it took, sat down to buy her a drink.
An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same.
And that’s the way that it’s been, years later she took your name.
Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her.

Tell me about the old days.
Another night at the Copper Coin.
Tell me about the old days.
Put the sun into the sea.

Because there ain’t nothing like your smile,
Your legs and those eyes.

Tell me about the old days.

Because there ain’t nothing like your smile,
Your legs and those eyes.
And I will beg
And steal and borrow
To keep you safe for your whole life.
