You know the kid, on some braggadocios shit, talkin’ bout liquor and bitches, party
And bullshit. If your looking for something deep and politically correct, you can do yourself
A favour right now and press skip

World in the palm of our hands and we love it
Suck our dicks

Tryna get them big bucks and get my dick sucked, tryna find a line and lose
My mind I don’t give two fucks. plus I got an army behind me no frontin’ they
Don’t call me the president for nothing, all of a sudden

We got the
World in the palm of our hands and we love it
Suck our dicks
If you don’t love it cause this shit ain’t for you

I don’t think you understand, we back by popular demand

Come with me, trust me you don’t wanna fuck with deez. what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

Come with me, trust me you don’t wanna fuck with deez. what do we have here now
Do you wanna ride or die, nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
