You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
But you don’t hear me though.

You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
But you don’t hear me though.

Please believe when I tell you take heed,
if the streets get hungry, then the streets gonna eat.
Nothing more dangerous then a man who got nothing to lose.
Now day that’s the majority and not the few.
If you got it, best believe they want it, hold it down stand your ground and
fight for it, they gone take it, if you let ’em, so you better watch your step,
for you get caught slippin’

Take minks off, take things off, take chains off, I take rings off
I know you know low lifes who know you got no fight
you came up as an artist, now it made you a target right?
No fans in the street.
Sick stick kids will grab you.
A sweet seat to get beat’s to eat feasts between crumb snatchers
add a toe tag to your swag, they blast you faster when you flash your clothes
bragging to whores, but it’s the boys at your door
and you don’t hear me though

You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
But you don’t hear me though.

You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
Big said damn

Big said damn, they wanna stick me for my paper and prey for my downfall,
I understand it all.

Big said damn, they wanna stick me for my paper and prey for my downfall,
I understand it all.

I understand it all.

I understand it all.

Big said damn, they wanna stick me for my paper and prey for my downfall,
I understand it all.

You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
But you don’t hear me though.

You’d better watch your fucking step, cause the streets are watching.
You’d better watch you fucking mouth, cause the streets are listening.
But you don’t hear me though.

OOOOOHHHHH
