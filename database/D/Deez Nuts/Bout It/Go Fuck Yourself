Now see triple six to me ain't the number of the beast, I see triple f yeah,
forever friends and family. But if we enemies it takes on a different meaning
entirely, like fuck you fuck go fuck yourself and everybody like you see.
We ain't like you, you never walked a mile in our shoes, if you were sandals we'd
be steel toe boots. Plus them boots is just to big to fill, for real, you little
fucks ain't even fit to lick the shit from my heel, name an innovator who ain't got
a million haters, you keep runnin' you mouth, I'll keep stacking my paper. And when
you see me you salute like I'm the motherfuckin' general, if not go fuck yourself
like your packing two kinds of genitals.

Go. This shit is getting tired. Fuck it's hard to let it slide
Your. Not even worth the scuffle. Self. Let it touch the hustle

Go. This shit is getting tired. Fuck it's hard to let it slide
Your. Not even worth the scuffle. Self. Let it touch the hustle

Go

Fuck

Yourself

Go fuck yourself

Go

Fuck

Yourself

Go fuck yourself

They call me The Cremator, incinerate, torture
Things burning out of control, the reapers here to take your soul
mentally vexed, cashing those checks
Blood lusting, I demand my respect

Go. This shit is getting tired. Fuck it's hard to let it slide
Your. Not even worth the scuffle. Self. Let it touch the hustle

Go. This shit is getting tired. Fuck it's hard to let it slide.
Your. Not even worth the scuffle. Self. Let it touch the hustle

Go

Fuck

Yourself

Go fuck yourself

Go

Fuck

Yourself

Go fuck yourself
