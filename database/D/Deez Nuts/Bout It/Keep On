Again and again and again I get tested
Feels like the walls are closing in I can’t escape it
It’s everywhere I turn so I can’t run from it
So many things I see make me sick to my stomach
Feel compassion and pain look at the world with disdain
But know that I’m part of the problem and it drives me insane
I see no light at the end of the tunnel
So I take no solace in a bullshit empty promise

So what the fuck am I supposed to do

But live like I got nothing left to lose

Again and again and again there’s no end
To the bullshit and the drama and the fake fucking friends
It’s me against the world I’ve made my peace with that
But fighting through this life alone I find no peace in that
Day after day I get more disillusioned
With every fuckin’ person on earth myself included
Everybody’s got there demons to battle
I just don’t know how much more of this shit I can handle

I feel the weight of the world and the pressures so great
I can feel my heart break every step that I take
But I keep on yeah I gotta be strong
Gotta make my momma proud, I gotta be my father’s son

I keep on

I keep on

I keep on
