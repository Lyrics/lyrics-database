Ooh, there's something burning in the air
Ooh, there's something burning in the air
The fire's spreading everywhere
Ooh, the fire's spreading everywhere

Ooh, there's something burning in the air
Ooh, there's something burning in the air
The fire's spreading everywheres
Ooh, the fire's spreading everywhere

Unhappy woman
Unhappy woman
Unhappy, unhappy woman
And I am an unhappy man

She's counting her time
She'll be just fine
She's counting the day
Come what may

She's counting her time
She'll be just fine
She's counting the day
Come what may

Stars explode
Moons erode and she waits there

A few hundred million miles above the sea

Stars explode
Moons erode and she waits there
She waits there for me

Unhappy woman
Unhappy woman
Unhappy, unhappy woman
And I am an unhappy man

(A few hundred million miles above the sea)

She knows it's ready when
Her eyes are almost open
The moon is blue and dim
The tide is surely rushing in

She knows it's ready when
Her eyes are almost open
The thunder moves her skin
Let's hope that she knows how to swim

She knows it's ready when
Her eyes are almost open
The moon is blue and dim
The tide is surely rushing in

She knows it's ready when
Her eyes are almost open
The thunder moves her skin
Let's hope that she knows how to swim

Ooh, there's something burning in the air
Ooh, there's something burning in the air
The fire's spreading everywhere
Ooh, the fire's spreading everywhere

Ooh, there's something burning in the air
Ooh, there's something burning in the air
The fire's spreading everywhere
Ooh, the fire's spreading everywhere
