There are no words
You could choose
That could change the way I feel and make me wanna stay
And I know
How you look
In my eyes
That there’s something on your mind that you’re not gonna say

Ooh, you feel me slippin’ out
Nothin’ to talk about
So why are you still holding on?
Ooh, it’s nothing that you said
The voices in my head
Are clearer than your foolish reasons

You wouldn’t have it any other way
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no (I’m tired, so tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way (I’m tired, I’m feeling tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no

You wouldn’t have it any other way
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no (I’m tired, so tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way (I’m tired, I’m feeling tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no

You are the one
I would choose
But a haunted heart wants what a haunted heart wants
And you
Know how you
Look in my eyes
But there’s nothing more now that I could even say to you

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya
I should have left it now it’s over
But here we are again

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I’m tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I’m tired of killing time)
Don’t wanna do it again

You wouldn’t have it any other way
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no (I’m tired, so tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way (I’m tired of killing time)
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no

You wouldn’t have it any other way
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no (I’m tired, so tired)
You wouldn’t have it any other way (I don’t wanna do it again)
You wouldn’t have it any other way, oh no

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I’m tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure (I’m tired of killing time)
Don’t wanna do it again

You act stoic like a soldier
I never said that I could hold ya (I’m tired, so tired)
No need to question my composure
I don’t wanna do it again

I don’t wanna…
I don’t wanna do it again
