Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father

Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father
Oh my father

Your love is like dark matter
Your love, it’s hard to explain
Your love is like dark matter
And I will never be the same

Your love is like dark matter
Your love, it’s hard to explain
Your love is like dark matter
And I will never be the same again

Ooo-ooo-ooh-ooh

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colours, but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it black

Oh my father, oh my father, oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know
Oh my father, oh my father, oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

She had your love once
Unconditional
But she feels lost now
A little outta control (a little outta control)

Now an invisible barrier
Around her skin
Protects her from danger
It won’t let anyone in, won’t let you in…

Ooo-ooo-ooh-ooh

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colors, but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it…

Ooo-ooo-ooh-ooh

Just another black echo in my head
You paint me in colors, but instead
You’re just another black echo in my head
You’re painting me, I paint it black

Oh my father, oh my father, oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know
Oh my father, oh my father, oh my father always told me so
But I still didn’t know

Black echo
You’re painting me, I paint it black
Black
Oh no
Echo
Just another echo
