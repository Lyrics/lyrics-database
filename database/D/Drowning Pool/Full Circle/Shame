Straight through you!

I burn, I burn
My tongue rhymes one thing, for eager ears to hold onto
You know I’ll lie again, you know I’ll try again
My words ripping, tearing straight through you

I, I turn my back on you
And I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I’ve got no time for you
And I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you

I burn, I burn

Let me touch you, let me get inside you
All I feel, I can make it feel all so real
You know I’ll lie again, you know I’ll try again
My words ripping, tearing straight through you

I, I turn my back on you
And I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I’ve got no time for you
And I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you

No, don’t you speak my name
Don’t you speak my name (I’m pain)
(Don’t you speak my name)
(Don’t you speak my name)

I, I turn my back on you
And I will, I will shame you, shame you
And I, won’t hold against you
If you never, never, never speak my name again!

I, I turn my back on you
And I will, I will, I will shame you, shame you
I, I’ve got no time for you and I will, I will
I will shame you, shame you

Shame you!
Don’t you speak my name!
I will shame you, shame you!
