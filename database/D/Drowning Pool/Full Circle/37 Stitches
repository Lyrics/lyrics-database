Do you see me sitting here?
Awaiting for you to say anything
Head hung low, kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to hell now
I’m waiting for you to say anything
Anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
My little taste of heaven
And you know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell

Your eyes scream, “The end is creeping in
I’ll need thirty-seven stitches to keep the pain in”
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun
On the darkest side of the sun, oo-oh yeah

Followed the piper’s sweet whistling
Guided down the path by the wrong hand
Closed my eyes for the chance of a better view
Closed my ears so I couldn’t hear you

I know you are the one
You know I am the one
Your bitter taste of hell!

I know you are the only one
My little taste of heaven
You know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell

Your eyes scream, “The end is creeping in
I’ll need thirty-seven stitches to keep the pain in”
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun

Do you see me sitting here?
Still waiting for you to say anything
Head hung low, kicking stones down
Kicking stones down the road to hell now
I’m waiting for you, I’m waiting for you
Just say anything, yeah

I know you are the only one
My little taste of heaven
You know I am the only one
Your bitter taste of hell!

Your eyes scream, “The end is creeping in
I’ll need thirty-seven stitches, thirty-seven stitches, yeah”
I know you are the only one
On the darkest side of the sun

I know, I know
On the darkest side of the sun
You are the one
On the darkest side of the sun
