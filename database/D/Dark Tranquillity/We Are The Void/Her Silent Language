Why do I see her through never-ending nights?
Why do I see her wearing nothing but the dark?

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I know where you live, I can see it through your darkness
And when you sleep, I hear the heart that beats you

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words

I fought into the distance, a life that does not connect
Time played out its part on the strings that bind us

Encounters in silence, words elude the fading night
Wish I could fathom what is too hard to tell

Her head hangs low in the silence of the room
Her head hangs low, she takes a bite out of her heart

Have you come here to warn me of what I cannot see?
You want to tell me something, but you do not have the words
