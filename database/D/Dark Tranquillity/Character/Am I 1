I grant to you
No privilege of person
No sense of self
A denial of choice

It wants out
So from all the little bits and pieces
A simple case of lost & found
A wicked new beginning you don’t ever want to see

It’s the oldest trick in the book
Just like everything you always knew
Turned upon its very end
There’s nothing left to be

I’ve got half a mind to say
All the things that bother me today

You better check if it’s me
In that coffin of yours
Or just the one
The one you thought you knew

I am one
Who am I?
No character
To be lost inside

A mind is hard to please
So wander aimlessly

Hands clenched in fists of rage
Concealed in frustration
There’s a part of me that cannot heal
With the character I am forced to be

A thinly veiled plan
To lay your world afoot
Lost in community
Blind in belonging

Is there really nothing more than this?
The emptiness remains
So put on your brave face
And take the plunge again

I am one
Who am I?
No character
To be lost inside
