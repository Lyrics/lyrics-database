No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie
No truth, no lie

It twists and turns
Into something that is not to be
What truth is left
What's abandoned as the life flew by
Our words are broken

We commit to our sacrifice
The betrayal of the code
Thrust into nothingness
No truth, no lie
Our words are broken

Our subconscious bias
Confirms what we already believe
There is no message, there is no value
Just the sheltering of false ideas

Tear our thoughts
Into splinters
Set the sense
That's forced to remember
Words get thrown
Out of focus as we
Test our will
Dissolve to nothing
Break all bounds
Of unfair holding
Track this line
To journey's end
We're breaking down
