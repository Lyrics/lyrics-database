(—— to do that)

Out for kicks and in for trouble
Running to the river’s edge
Take a look in the dark water
Won’t recognise what you see there

Walking down, down by the river
Frogs are jumping and the catfish flies

Oh, down the river of no return
Desperate men wait down by the river
Whispering shadows by the river’s edge
Would-be assassins or pleasure seekers

By the moon no way to tell
Black thoughts, black water
Smooth surface, hidden undertow

River’s edge round the river’s bend
Around the river that never ends

The skeletons dance with sex by the riverside

(I saw a girl, was a killer)
(Murdered her love in June)
(Walking away from the river)
Leaving behind the king of fools
Dark moon’s red river
Coloured by the howling moon

River’s edge round the river’s bend
Around the river that never ends

Darkness snakes a sideways glance
From the river’s other side

Ride the river of no return

From the big black swamp
Reptile eyes
Comes a sideways glance
From the river’s other side
