Tonight we ride
’Cause we’re burning up inside

I’m checking out of Heartbreak Hotel
I’m never going back again
Tattooed flames and a bike
We race through the night, through the night

Tonight we ride to get away from everything
And anything at all
Tonight we ride and I don’t care about all you purile views
They’re just yesterday’s news

I’m checking out of Heartbreak Hotel
I’m never going back again
Tattooed flames and a bike
We race through the night, through the night

Tonight

Get away from everything
And everywhere I’ve been
I don’t care about your views
They’re just yesterday’s news

I’m checking out of Heartbreak Hotel
I’m never going back again
Tattooed flames and a bike
We race through the night, we race through the night

Tonight
Tonight
Tonight

(—— too much)
(—— too much)
(—— too much)
(—— too much)

(—— too much)
(—— too much)
(—— too much)
(—— too much)
