I don’t know why, but I know it’s true
That I fell straight away from the moment I saw you
You came into my life, and as quickly you were gone
Like a wild wind

With a glance you stole my heart
Parted our ways right from the start
Only the lonely know how I feel tonight
Tonight and every night

I still sleep with the love of you
Still feeling that I’m certain of you still
But you slipped into the night like a ghostly tragedy
Just a wild wind

With a glance you stole my heart
Parted our ways right from the start
Only the lonely know how I feel tonight
Tonight and every night

I don’t know why, but I know it’s true
That I fell straight away from the moment I saw you
You came into my life, and as quickly you were gone
Like a wild wind

Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind

Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind

Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind

Chase the wild wind
Chase the wild wind
