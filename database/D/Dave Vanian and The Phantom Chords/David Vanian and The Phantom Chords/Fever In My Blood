I taste midnight bittersweet
A cursing curse in a hell saloon
On my knees, howling at the moon

You are the fever in my blood
You are the fever in my blood
Fire, a burning fire

I roam nights like a dog on heat
The demon rides like the silken road
I bare my soul in a bloody roar

You are the fever in my blood
You are the fever in my blood
Fire, a burning fire
Burning, burning ring of fire

On my knees
I bare my soul in a bloody roar

You are the fever in my blood
You are the fever in my blood
Fire
I’m burning, a burning fire

Yeah I’m on my knees
I’m on my knees
Fire, fire, burning fire
