Sensation washes over me, I can’t describe it
Pain I felt so long ago, I don’t remember
Tear a hole so I can see my devastation
Feelings from so long ago I don’t remember

Holding on, to let them know
What’s given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

Blind your eyes to what you see, you can’t embrace it
Leave it well enough alone and don’t remember
Cut your pride and watch it bleed, you can’t deny it
Pain you know you can’t ignore I don’t remember

Holding on, to let them know
What’s given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me

Sensation washes over me
I can’t describe it
Pain I felt so long ago
I don’t remember

I’m just holding on, to let them know
What’s given to me, given to me
To hide behind I mask this time
And try to believe

If I can remember
To know this will conquer me
If I can just walk alone
And try to escape into me

Into me…

Into me…
