I'll stick you a little
Enough to take your oxygen away
Set you on fire
'Cause I'm on fire
And I'm with you alone
I'm so into this whore
Afraid I might lose her
So forget about me
'Cause I'll stick you

Pushed back to square
Now that you've kneed her
In the throat, well, there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders
Of all
Transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do

Pushed back to square
Now that you need her
But you don't, so there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders
Of all
So transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do
Transpose
Or stop your life
It's what you do

Pushed back to square
Now that you've kneed her
In the throat, now there you go
'Cause back in school
We are the leaders
Of it all

We are
We are

All you are
All you are
All you are
All you are
Is meat
