Don’t wake me up, I’m winning wars inside my head.
And maybe I’m weak, but not beneath the covers of this bed.
Asleep, I’m undefeated in this world of mine.
So let me stay inside this dream, and keep me from the light.
I built this place behind my eyes you’ll never see.
And you can move my body, but please keep my mind asleep.
Beyond the galaxies where there’s no space or time.
I will transform, I am reborn to rule over the skies.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It’s all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!

Behind the darkness, there’s a sea of neon lights.
And maybe you think I’m sinking, but you just can’t get inside.
Don’t try to save me when my mind is finally free.
Cause I’d rather run my own world than face your reality.
It’s not enough for me to paint with black and white.
Inside my head there are shades of red unknown to waking life.
You think you travel far and never see the stars.
Cause the only way is if I say you can follow me that far.
I
I feel it in my bones, escape the world I know.
It’s all in my control.
I
Just wanna see this way, blood pumping in my veins.
I feel it. I feel it!
