You’re weak and you’re gullible,
and I don’t care.

You’re a walking disaster,
and I don’t care.

You cry yourself to sleep,
and I don’t care.

You’re wasting our time,
and I don’t care.

You knew this day would come, and it did,
and you really should have waited.

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I’m so faded.

You knew this day would come, and it did,
and you really should have waited.

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I’m so faded.

You contradict everything,
and I don’t care.

Your logic is twisted,
and I don’t care.

I’ll pretend to be happy,
and I don’t care.

You cry yourself to sleep,
and I don’t care.

You’re weak and you’re gullible,
and I don’t care.

You’re a walking disaster,
and I don’t care.

You knew this day would come, and it did,
and you really should have waited.

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I’m so faded.

You knew this day would come, and it did,
and you really should have waited.

Go cry yourself to sleep, and you should,
because I’m so faded.
