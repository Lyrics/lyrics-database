Pump the brakes, you’re a red-flag, red light
Holdin’ up for stop signs. I’ll never be sloppy seconds
Go ahead, take them back, your one, two, three minutes
All you do is take, take, takin’ off the little
Got More goin’ on I’d rather be eating glass,
Stick hot needles in my eyes,
Go ahead and tap that ass
Draw them up, yeah like there’s candy
Girl I ain’t tryin’a connect or paint a picture
I’m not in it, never will be
You can’t be me, get your freak on,
You can suck it, they’ve all seen it
And you liked it, now who wants it?
Cotton candy sugar high
Break your bones when you come down
You’re a one trick, my trick pony who’s next to hop on
Ride, ride, ride…
Bout to bring a blood spill
We’ve both been there, what’s the next stop? I won’t sit still
Back to bring up what’s real
We’ve both been there, what’s the next stop? I won’t sit still
