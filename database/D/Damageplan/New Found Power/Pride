I’m sickened.
I know I’ve been betrayed,
But I keep ignoring
The warning signs.

You tell me
That I’m not beneath you,
But you act above me.
Knives in my spine.

Now with all the money in the world
You can’t buy my respect.
Yeah, it’s just a matter of pride
But that’s all I’ve got left.

I reach up
For your hand as you stand
Looking down on me, but
You turn your back.

I believed you.
Now everything
That we had that I thought was sacred
Has turned to black.

Now with all the money in the world
You can’t buy my respect.
Yeah, it’s just a matter of pride
But that’s all I’ve got left.

Right!

Now with all the money in the world
You can’t buy my respect.
Yeah, it’s just a matter of pride
But that’s all I’ve got left.

Right!
Right!
Right!
