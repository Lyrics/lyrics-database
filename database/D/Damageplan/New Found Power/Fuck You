Fuck you, I’m through.
I want nothing more from you.
My sanity is wearing thin.

Irate, I hate.
You determined your own fate
Now everything is caving in

Fuck your power trip and
Fuck your attitude and
Fuck your bloated ego, too.
Fuck your history, your tragedy, your misery
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck this, all of this
Bitch and moan and bleed and piss
Seconds away from goin’ down

Go ahead and push me
Your fakery, your butchery
Is nothing compared to my hate for you

Fuck your apathy and
Fuck your empathy and
Fuck your nihilism, too
Fuck your bitter pills, take em all, you
Never will
But most of all, fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

You consulate, just a touch
Let myself be considered for themselves
Let’s sit up
Hear that sound
It’s not time to hang out

The summer eclipse doesn’t exist
Don’t watch it and hate the world

You’re the one that slipped
XXX

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

Nothing changes, nothing fazes,
Nothing stays the same.

XXX
You can’t get it out
XXX

So swallow it all!

Fuck your power trip and
Fuck your attitude and
Fuck your bloated ego, too.
Fuck your history, your tragedy, your misery
But most of all, motherfucker fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
Fuck you!
