Identity murdered, malicious intent.
I’m recreating myself at last.
Rise up from destruction, start over again,
Reborn, I’m now erasing the past.

Did you think for a second I
Wouldn’t bother to question why
You always put me last?
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you’re excreting all your lies?
Your time is coming fast!

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

Everything now that would stand in my way
Is doomed to take the impact to come.
You think you can stop me, you’d best think again.
You want a piece of me? Come get some!

Did you think for a second I
Wouldn’t bother to question why
You always put me last?
Can you look straight into my eyes
As you’re excreting all your lies?
Your time is coming fast!

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

So everything that you’ve throwing at me
Has only helped me make up my mind.
And all you do will amount to nothing.
You can’t effect me, don’t even try.

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

I’m reborn.
I’ve seen the light!
I’m reborn.

Reborn.
I’m reborn!

Reborn.
I’m reborn!

I’ve seen the light!
I’ve seen the light!
I’ve seen the light!
I’ve seen the light!
