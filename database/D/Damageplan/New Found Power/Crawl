Forced my strength out of determination,
I’ve survived this long on will.
Dropped so many times that I’ve lost count.
Never stopped me once, never known anything else.

Anything else.

Try and break me down, I’ll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can’t

Suffer, sacrifice, or walk away.
Make your play and risk it all.
New found power pumping through my veins,
Based on brotherhood,
Once it starts it can’t be stopped.
(can’t be stopped)

Try and break me down, I’ll
Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can’t

Pick my teeth back up and crawl.

Sometimes it seemed like it just wasn’t meant to be
Anger and sorrow were all that I would ever feel
Sometimes I’d dream the man that had it all was me,
Then I’d awake each time to cold reality.

But I can’t wait for things to change.
Complacency is not my way.
Self-absorbed, I had lost my faith, I was
Breaking down from your apathy, now it
Feeds my hatred for all you stand for and
I can’t live like this one minute more, so
Just how much blood do you have to swallow?
Before you can lead, you must refuse to follow
Now I bite the hand that starves me
Don’t look so surprised it’s you that created me

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can’t.

Pick my teeth back up and

Crawl back to my feet and stand.
Crawl, try and break me, you can’t.

Crawl
Crawl
Crawl
Crawl
