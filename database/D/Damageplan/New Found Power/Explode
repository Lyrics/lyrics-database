Explode!

I feel you stare, watch me not care.
Glare at the freak, you’ve no control,
Feel your eyes probing me, judging me
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!

You don’t know me but you fear me.
Tainted with ink, riddled with holes,
Staring and pointing, stupidity
Only makes me want to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

All that’s you see, scars that’s made me.
See in your eyes, all you despise,
Judge me by what you see, leave me be,
Get away I’m going to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!

Fear what you don’t understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don’t understand.
As it always was.

Fear what you don’t understand.
It will always be.
Fear what you don’t understand
I just want to

Explode, just explode!
Explode, just explode!
