Wake up!

Our lives are entwined, can’t escape
But you and I have never stood face-to-face
Still I can’t get away
Think that you can just step right in/
Push me out and then fuck things all up again?
It never seems to end.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Wake up!
Wake up!

Cling to skeletons, fearing change,
Paralyzed thinking what the future will bring.
You’re killing everything.

Pure adrenaline, I tear in
Hatred is my fuel
Truth dissects you again
And you’ve run out of friends

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

And now it’s time, the countdown begins.
Extracting the truth, what was from what is.
And once and for all we lay it to rest
And never look back again.

Never again!
Never again!
Never again!
Never again!

I can’t believe all the things done to me.
Sight unseen.
You don’t know one fucking thing but you
Judge me.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up ’cause you know it’s a lie.
Do you think that you’re better than me?
You better wake up.

Wake up!
Wake up!
