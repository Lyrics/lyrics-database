(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)

Waiting for the last time
For my friend to change my mind
Waiting for the last drop
Seems like a long, long time

Maybe I should go back home
I’ll sit and wait right by the phone
Praying over the porcelain throne
On my dirty sticky floor

(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)

Ask me what I want
Easy — that’s just more
How long will I wait for you?
Twice as long as I did before

Standing in the freezing snow
Maybe you left, I just don’t know
I’ll soon be lying on my own
On some dirty sticky floor

(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)

I hope no one can see me
The tinman says I’m doing fine
That lion ain’t going to get me
See that gun right there — it’s mine

I’ve painted a face where I burnt the floor
Now the face has become my devil’s door
Laying in the back-room
On my dirty sticky floor

(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)
(Ooooh-ooh)

My dirty sticky…

(Ooooh-ooh)
