Put on your blindfold
And a dress that’s tight
And come with me
On a mystery night
Open your eyes

Follow our stars under a painted sky
We’ll leave the world behind
We’re learning to fly
We used to get by

Forget the pictures on your TV screen
We’ll steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on

I was blind, and I saw the light
My angel coming
In a brilliant white
Shine for me

You’ve been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It’s difficult not to
Shine for me

Follow our stars under a painted sky
We’ll leave the world behind
We’re learning to fly
We used to get by
Forget the pictures on your TV screen
We’ll steal the visions
That you keep for your dreams
You can turn me on

You’ve been hanging from a rope of mediocrity
Strung up by your insecurities
You can shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It’s difficult not to
Shine for me
Somebody has to
Shine for me
It’s difficult not to
Shine for me
