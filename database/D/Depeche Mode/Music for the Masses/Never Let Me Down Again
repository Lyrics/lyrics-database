I’m taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
He knows where he’s taking me
Taking me where I want to be
I’m taking a ride with my best friend

We’re flying high
We’re watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down
On the ground

I’m taking a ride with my best friend
I hope he never lets me down again
Promises me I’m safe as houses
As long as I remember who’s wearing the trousers
I hope he never lets me down again

We’re flying high
We’re watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground

We’re flying high
We’re watching the world pass us by
Never want to come down
Never want to put my feet back down on the ground

Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down
Never let me down

(See the stars, they’re shining bright)
Never let me down
(Everything’s alright tonight)
Never let me down

(See the stars, they’re shining bright)
Never let me down
(Everything’s alright tonight)
Never let me down

(See the stars, they’re shining bright)
Never let me down
(Everything’s alright tonight)
Never let me down

(See the stars, they’re shining bright)
Never let me down
(Everything’s alright tonight)
Never let me down
