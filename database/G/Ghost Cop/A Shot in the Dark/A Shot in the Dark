Just as you are
Rebel, roused
Scratching some weird skin
I heard your voice

Come as you are
Tempted by
This morning star
It’s happening

Like a sinner picks the saint
Like a moth flies to a flame
I’m lost without control

As you know
Like the grey before the storm
The end before it’s begun
The wheels turn round again

Just let it go
Everything you want
It’s better than nothing
Just let me go
Everything you want
Well that’s what you get

Like a shot in the dark
A solo survivor
Straight through the heart
No one makes it out alive
As you know
Like the angel loves the Fall
The way to the City of Woe
What’s buried in the snow
Comes forth in the thaw

Just let me go
Everything you want
It’s better than nothing
I close my eyes
Everything you want
Well that’s what you get

Just let me die
You get everything you want

Like a shot in the dark
Like a shot in the dark
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark (just let me go)
Like a shot in the dark
