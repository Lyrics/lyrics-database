I drink alone
Ye-yeah, with nobody else
I drink alone
Ye-yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

Now every morning just before breakfast
I don’t want no coffee or tea
Just me and good buddy Wiser
That’s all I ever need
’Cause I drink alone, yeah
With nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

Yeah, the other night I laid sleeping
And I woke from a terrible dream
So I caught up my pal Jack Daniel
And his partner Jimmy Beam
And we drank alone
Ye-yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

Yeah, the other day I got invited to a party
But I stayed home instead
Just me and my pal Johnnie Walker
And his brothers Black and Red
And we drank alone
Ye-yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

Yeah, my whole family done give up on me
And it makes me feel, oh, so bad
The only one who will hang out with me
Is my dear old granddad
And we drink alone
Ye-yeah, with nobody else
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself
Yeah, you know when I drink alone
I prefer to be by myself

I drink alone
