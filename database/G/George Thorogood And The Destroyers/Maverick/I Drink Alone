I drink alone,
Yeah, with nobody else,
I drink alone,
Yeah, with nobody else.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

Now, every morning just before breakfast,
I don’t want no coffee or tea.
Just me and my good buddy, Weiser,
That’s all I ever need.
’Cause I drink alone,
Yeah, with nobody else.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah, the other night I lay sleeping
And I woke from a terrible dream.
So I called up my pal Jack Daniel,
And his partner Jimmy Beam,
And we drank alone.
Yeah, with nobody else.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah, the other day I got invited to a party,
But I stayed home instead,
Just me and my pal Johnnie Walker,
And his brothers, Blacky and Red.
And we drank alone.
Yeah, with nobody else.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah, my whole family done give up on me,
And it makes me feel all so bad.
The only one who’ll hang out with me
Is my dear Old Grand-Dad.
And we drink alone.
Yeah, with nobody else.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

Yeah, you know when I drink alone,
I prefer to be by myself.

I drink alone.
