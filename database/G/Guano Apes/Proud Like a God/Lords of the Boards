I’ve got the snowboard under my feet
I can fly so high, I can fall so deep
But who do I see comin’ up the track?
A little green man with a snowboard on his back

He said, “And now I’m flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burning, and I grab into another world”

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re mad like a clown

I could stay behind him, if I can
I wanna be a little more than an “also-ran”
Through every curb he’s got me beat
And maybe it’s time that I accept defeat

“And now I’m flying like an angel to the sun
My feet are burning, and I grab into another world”

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re mad like a clown

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re mad like a clown

(Lords of the boards)

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re mad like a clown

With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re come again around
With the lords of the boards you’re mad like a clown

(With the lords of the boards)
