Don’t give me names
You’ve got it all, you took it all away
Drove me insane
Who’d come down to earth, releasing me?

Healing my wounds
Why don’t you close the door when you’re leaving me?
Now you’ll run
Running all the way back to me again

It’s not to end the shame
To fight an endless lie
I’m not to play a game
I won’t be on your side

I found a way
To reach myself again, but all I saw was shame
Drive me away
There’s something deep in me, waiting to escape
You think you know me
So why don’t you close the door when you’re here with me?

I’m here to end the game (I’m here to end the game)
I’m living in a lie
It’s hard to give the same
I won’t be on your side, won’t be on your side

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you alone

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you alone

I’m now living, I’m now living in a lie
I’m now living, I’m now living in a lie
Lie
Lie

I’m now living, I’m now living in a lie
I’m now living, I’m now living in a lie
Lie
Lie

I’m here to end the game (I’m here to end the game)
I’m living a lie
It’s hard to give the same
I won’t be on your side, won’t be on your side

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you alone

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot
I leave you alone, yeah!

I loved you a lot
Yeah
To need you a lot
Yeah

I loved you a lot
To need you a lot

I loved you a lot
To need you
