You can get it
Come and climb under my skin
Overtake it
Pushing me on a fast lane
Come, let’s get away
No one knows you like I do
We will pass it
Let the tires kiss the ground

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from
Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from

I’m your engine
Got you strapped into my seat
Here’s our tactic
We get faster the more I scream
Come, let’s get away
No one drives you like I do
I’m collapsing
Let the tires kiss the ground

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from
Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from

Break the line…

And all I try
Is to break the thin line
Nothing’s gonna
Stop the way of life
Be sure that it’s safe
I’ll show you a place
Where we can be and everyone is dreaming of…
(Ah…)

You should go ahead
(So fast)
You should go ahead
(So fast)

Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from
Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from

Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from
Break the line
We have to go
’Cause there’s no way back
Where we’re coming from

Break the line
