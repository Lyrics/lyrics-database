Pretty in scarlet
So pretty in scarlet

We slept a while
To turn it off
And get it out of our minds
I slept a while
To get it all (get it all)
It seems alright
To find a place without a single lie
Where is the night
We ran into

’Cause nothing is good
I can’t explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
’Cause nothing is good
I can’t explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say…

It’s o.k.
It doesn’t count
Found my place
A deeper sound
Let me dive alone
Let me dive alone

You gave me wine
To poison me
And take away my time
I can hear you cry
I wonder why

’Cause nothing is good
I can’t explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
The night I kissed you goodbye
’Cause nothing is good
I can’t explain
Falling down and caught up the rain
I turn myself into changes
Your death is over

You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye
You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet
I turn myself to say goodbye

Pretty in scarlet
Pretty in scarlet
So pretty in scarlet!

You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet
You want to live a lie
And I’m pretty in scarlet
Come on
You wanna wash it down
And I’m pretty in scarlet

And I run, and I run, and I run, and I run away

And if you throw a stone on me
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies
I will run, I will run, I will run, I will run away

And if you throw a stone on me
And if you need some pain to see
And if you live your lies
I will run
