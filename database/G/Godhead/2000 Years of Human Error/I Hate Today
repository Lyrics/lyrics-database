Slowly he settles down
To give them what they want
He tries to keep himself
Together

I would slam my head in the ground
Before I tell you this
He turns his head to the floor
As it falls away

I’m a product of your hate
Just the one that you’d create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today

You taught me everything you know
The blame will surely show, yea
I tried to keep it down
Forever

The days have taken years
To conquer all my fears
I stand before you now
Sickened and cut down

I’m a product of your hate
Just the one that you’d create
Is anybody listening to a word I say?
I hate today
