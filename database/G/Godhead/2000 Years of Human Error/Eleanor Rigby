Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there’s nobody there
What does he care?

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks trom the grave
No one was saved

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people

All the lonely people…
All the lonely people…
All the lonely people…
All The lonely people…

All The lonely people…
All The lonely people…
All The lonely people…
All The lonely people…

Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name

Ah, look at all
The lonely people

(Aah)

All the lonely people,
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
Where do they all belong?

Ah, look at all
The lonely people
Ah, look at all
The lonely people

Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
