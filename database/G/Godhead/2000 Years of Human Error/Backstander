I wish I was free now
You drive me into a place
Where I barely can hide from you
Moments at a time

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you
I’m always turning around to see you standing on my back

Sometimes I find that my delivery is all the same
And when I look at you, I instinctively start the game
I never see what you mean when you
Start to weep and scream at me
Oh no, the ringing in my head again
Oh no, you’re ripping off my face again

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you
I’m always turning around to see you standing on my back

Why?

You’re just a pretty face
You’re just a pretty face

You know I never sleep
To keep myself away from you
I’m always turning around to see you standing on my back
