Come to me, kll for me, worship me
Follow everything I do, act it out before me
I’m the one they told you would come again
Let me show you all the signs to bring about the end

I’ll take you down
To a hole where you will always be alone
I’ll turn you out
On a world that doesn’t care if you belong
I’ll push you off
Of the throne that you erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the filth that you created

I watched you take the power in your hands and throw it all away
I knew you would fall down again someday
Come on now, you know I won’t hurt you
Come on now, I’m here to protect you
Come on now, I’ll lead you to a shelter
Come on now, you know

I’ll take you down
To a hole where you will always be alone
I’ll turn you out
On a world that doesn’t care if you belong
I’ll push you off
Of the throne that you erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the filth that you created

I’ll take you down
To a hole where you will always be alone
I’ll turn you out
On a world that doesn’t care if you belong
I’ll push you off
Of the throne that you erected for yourself
You will be tossed
On a pile of all the filth that you created
