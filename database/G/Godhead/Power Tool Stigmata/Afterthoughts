Sifting through
The ashes of my life
I thought I found the one
That I could always trust

Slowly I
Began to learn that I
Can never judge the things
That mean the most to me

And all the hate and anger
They all put on you
You just
Threw on me

And I don’t believe
That I could ever be with you
And I don’t believe
That we could ever be together

Calling out to you, try to show the truth
But you just carry on
Killing everything that we once had
And never really understanding why

And I don’t believe
That I could ever be with you
And I don’t believe
That we could ever be together

You’ve taken everything
And left me here with nothing
Taken everything
And left me here with nothing

You’ve taken everything
And left me here with nothing
Taken everything
And left me here with nothing

You’ve taken everything
And left me here with nothing
Taken everything
And left me here with nothing

And I don’t believe
That I could ever be with you
And I don’t believe
That we could ever be together
