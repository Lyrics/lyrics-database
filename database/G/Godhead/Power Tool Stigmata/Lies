I can stand although my bones are breaking
Prop me up and see my soul is aching
Take the dirt upon the ground around me
Bury me inside the grave I built for you

Walk into the room
Feel my stare of doom
Scars that line my face
Lies cannot replace

I can see through you
And I’ll tell you

All my life I’ve heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else’s eyes

Kill you with my words
Get what you deserve

I can see through you
And I’ll tell you

All my life I’ve heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else’s eyes

All my life I’ve heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else’s eyes

Remember what you did to me?
For you know I won’t forget
Now you’ve broken everything
Is your heart filled with regret?

All my life I’ve heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else’s eyes

All my life I’ve heard a thousand lies
Seen myself through someone else’s eyes

Remember what you did to me?
For you know I won’t forget
