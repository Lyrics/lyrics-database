I can’t know
What you feel inside
But your face can’t hide
Your foolish pride

Keep in mind
All you left behind
Was in chains that bind
Is that a sign?

I can’t read
What you keep inside your mind
Protecting what I find
Within your walls

Things I feel
That I know just can’t be real
Trick and try to steal
My life away

Cold deception goes both ways (cold deception goes both ways)
Watch yourself or you’ll get bathed (watch yourself or you’ll get bathed)
In the darkness that is light (in the darkness that is light)
As your spirit dies tonight (as your spirit dies tonight)

I’ll tell you something
I know I must be strong
For your giving me something
That I know is wrong

I can’t know
What you feel inside
But your face can’t hide
Your foolish pride (your foolish pride)

Keep in mind
All you left behind
Was in chains that bind
Is that a sign?

Your intentions become clear (your intentions become clear)
All deceptions disappear (all deceptions disappear)
The inception of your plan (the inception of your plan)
Marks the end of modern man (marks the end of modern man)

I’ll tell you something
I know I must be strong
For your giving me something
That I know is wrong
