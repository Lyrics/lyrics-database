I can’t see myself too clearly
The clouds are rolling in
I can’t hear the noise around me
But I know the sound of sin

Where will I be
When the world falls down?
Head first in the mud bent over
With devils all around

Kill this craving
I can’t stop myself

Calling for me in my sleep
I hear the sirens flying in
Can’t turn back, I’m in too deep
I take another shot of gin

Keeping the world
From consuming me
Can’t hold back the demon growling
From deep beneath my sea

Kill this craving
I can’t stop myself

Madness raving
Take me straight to Hell

Calling for me in my sleep
Can’t turn back, I’m in too deep
As she rides upon my chest
Pain or joy, I love her best

Takes me far into her soul
Crawling, churning, can’t let go
As I ride upon her breast
Takes me down before I save my soul…
