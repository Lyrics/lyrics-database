I don’t believe you when you say
That you don’t know what you are
I try to understand why you
Are never happy

You live your life in fantasy
And glass cathedrals
Why don’t you come down from your cloud
And face reality?

I want
I love
I need
I breathe
I lust
I trust
I cheat
I bleed

Behind the walls they built for you
You live your orchestrated life
Inside your heart you know it’s wrong
But you can’t stop it

Your soul, it longs for something more
But never finds it
And so you blame me for it all
And choose another

I want
I love
I need
I breathe
I lust
I trust
I cheat
I bleed
