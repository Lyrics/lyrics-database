I wouldn’t waste my time
With anyone but you
But wasting time is all I do
Holding on to self control
Gets harder every day
Torture me no more or go away

I wait for you To see the truth
I’ll tell myself you’ll
Learn the answer
I’ll count the days
I’ve suffered through
To see if they add up to you

I never look into your eyes
To see the truth
I know I’ll never become you
Tell me why your conscience lies
And all your guilt is gone
Don’t you feel you ever could be wrong?

I wait for you to learn the answer
I’ll count the days
I’ve suffered through
To see if they add up to you
It never pays To struggle through
When all that’s left is killing you
