So much for you
I can’t take this life
To be with you
Only pushes me, deeper down

Guilt, pain, and sorrow
Are what haunt me still
Waking tomorrow
Will I feel the same?

Memories breaking me
Kill what I used to be

Wandering on
I know misery
Alone in silence
All I had before, gone from me

Look to the past
For any comforting
Happiness lasts
Only when you’re dead

Memories breaking me
Kill what I used to be

Can I feel again
Emotions that have brought me here?
Lost somewhere in time
Never to return again

Memories breaking me
Kill what I used to be

Falling back on myself
For I know no one else
