(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I’m living without you
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
But I know all about you
I have run you down into the ground
Spread disease about you over town

(A-a-ah-a-ah)
Used to adore you
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
Couldn’t control you
There was nothing that I wouldn’t do
To keep myself around and close to you

Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know
But I’ve run out of patience
I couldn’t care less

(A-a-ah-a-ah)
(A-a-ah-a-ah)

Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know

(A-a-ah-a-ah)
Used to amuse you
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I knew that I’d use you

Now you’re here and begging for a chance
But there’s no way in hell I’ll take you back

Do you have an opinion?
A mind of your own?
I thought you were special
I thought you should know

But I’ve run out of patience
I’ve run out of comments
I’m tired of your violence
I couldn’t care less

I’m looking for a new
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I’m looking for a new
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I’m looking for a new
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I’m looking for a new
(A-a-ah-a-ah)

You were the talk of the town
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
You were the talk of the town
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
You were the talk of the town
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
You were the talk of the town
(A-a-ah-a-ah)

I thought you were special
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I thought you were special
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I thought you were special
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I thought you were special
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
I thought you were special
(A-a-ah-a-ah)
