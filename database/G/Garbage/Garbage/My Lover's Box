(Go!)

My lover’s charms are in a box
Beneath my bed
And piece by piece I’ll cherish them
Until the end

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I’m afraid I’ll never get to heaven

They burn my house, scar my face
And blind my eyes
I’ll steal your breath, and throw away
What I despise

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I’m afraid I’ll never get to heaven

Du-du-du-dup-dup-du
Du-du-du-dup-dup-du
Du-du-du-dup-dup-du
Du-du-du-dup-dup-du

Between these walls
And darkened halls
I’ve done my time
If I should die before I wake, then you’ll know why

Send me an angel to love
I need to feel a little piece of heaven
Send me an angel to love
I’m afraid I’ll never get to heaven (piece by piece)

Send me an angel to love (piece by piece)
I need to feel a little piece of heaven (piece by piece)
Send me an angel to love (piece by piece)
I’m afraid I’ll never get to heaven (piece by piece)

Du-du-du-dup-dup-du (piece by piece)
Du-du-du-dup-dup-du (piece by piece)
Du-du-du-dup-dup-du

Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel (piece by piece)

Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel (piece by piece)
Send me an angel
