No one plans for the unthinkable,
Just the drive to move ahead…
To cure the sick, to do what’s possible,
You get the spare parts from a relative…

And Ebola Reston should send a red flag up,
But there’s no ticking sound…
Step by step, inch by inch,
Silent running always…

Take a jungle beast that’s 98% the same,
Kill the thing and part it out…
And then control will look for bugs they know,
But you can’t find what you’re not looking for…

And Ebola Reston should send a red flag up,
But there’s no ticking sound…
Step-by-step, inch-by-inch,
Silent running always…

Ebola Reston is somewhere waiting
And might be in you now.
