[Highly toxic, carcinogenic poison]
[Whatever it is, sell it]
[Fundamental right of man to have access to the good things in life]

Push
Meat, blood and hair
Mother-to-mother
Push
Born of the mud
Dried in the salt air
Push
Down at the root
Slipping from somewhere

Brown
[Highly toxic, carcinogenic poison]
Brown
[Whatever it is, sell it]

Push
Slick with the sweat
Fed by the bright air
Push
Sky, not a roof
Ground, not a bottom
Push
This is not yours
You are the worldâ€™s

Brown
[Whatever it is, sell it]
Brown
[Fundamental right of man to have access to the good things in life]
Brown
