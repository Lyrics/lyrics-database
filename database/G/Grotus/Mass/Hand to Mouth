Pulling that ball and chain is such a hassle
At 9 AM
Everything interesting happens at night, so
I’m up then
I’m slackadaisical about the future
Now that it’s here
Always cheerfully hopeless and broke, so I’m dopeless
Thank god for friends, thank god for friends

The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
Getting mighty slim
The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
I’m check-to-check, I’m hand-to-mouth

My weekly sacrifice of five days for two
Seems like a hell of a waste of my time
It’s a strain looking busy making junk for nothing
So I decline
If the only way to judge success is through cashflow
Then I don’t know
’Cause I could do anything with my life, but I
Probably won’t, no

The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
Getting mighty slim
The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
I’m check-to-check, I’m hand-to-mouth

The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
Getting mighty slim
The possibilities of getting by are getting mighty slim
I’m check-to-check, I’m hand-to-mouth
