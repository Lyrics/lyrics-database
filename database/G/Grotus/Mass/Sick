Gonna pack my bag and settle all this bullshit
I pack my new friends away
Ten thousand pills for everybody’s headache
No biz as usual today

Yeah, I’m sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah
Sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah

When that barrel sings, there is no disappointment
And justice won’t have to wait
You bet I won’t be missing one appointment
My sentence happens today

Yeah, I’m sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah
Sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah

Sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah
Sick of always
Trying to do what’s right, yeah
