It oughta make you sick
All the crap we’re fed today
Ah, but what the hell
We all like it anyway

You can come, you can come on down
And bring the bowl full of popcorn
Between the death and the weather
We’ll see who’s doing who now

Dumbed down to nothing
That’s entertainment
Puffed up like something
Solid

Two chunks of flesh
Done up to make you crazed
Well oiled and lit
Flexing full of silicone

The hormonal hustle
Yeah, it works every time
Hear the bell and get your pellet
Now drool like a dog

Dumbed down to nothing
That’s entertainment
Puffed up like something
Solid

Dumbed down to nothing
That’s entertainment
Puffed up like something
Solid
