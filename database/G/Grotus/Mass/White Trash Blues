Better make it black, my lids are logs
Yeah, I suppose I should go
Sniff my skin, scratch my chin
Is your smell trapped in my clothes?
Settle something, little children
Pacifiers drawn
Gimme something to chew on
As the hours roll

Cry on, baby, cry me a river
Say I should leave you alone
Cry on, baby, salt for the ocean
Chaos to make you whole

So the angels wept
And the sky ripped open
Lord took a piss on my soul
Life is long, long and tiresome
Dream myself into a hole
Ah!
Well, I can’t say I’m bored and lonely
Elvis, Elvis counsel me
I gotta get up in the morning

Cry on, baby, cry me a river
Say I should leave you alone
Cry on, baby, salt for the ocean
Chaos to make you whole
