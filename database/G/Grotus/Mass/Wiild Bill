The opportunity knocked, and now he’s somewhere else
The big muscles shake when used on himself
Testosterone congeals in his hand
In the shape of a fist around his magic wand

And Wild Bill just sits watching cable
His hell raising fades into flab
The iron fist armchair judge presiding
Exiled from the black box himself

Some kind of focused beam shot him out of the set
To fulfill his dream to offer real help
He used to shake the world, hе used to cause some griеf
But now it’ll take a crane to peel him off his seat

And Wild Bill just sits watching cable
As his hell raising fades into flab
The iron fist armchair judge presiding
Exiled from the black box himself

And Wild Bill just sits watching cable
As his hell raising fades into flab
The iron fist armchair judge presiding
Exiled from the black box himself
