Sunrise, sunset
Days turn into weeks and years
And as the grind bears down, you get into this shape
Bored and numb and full of self-hate

Your eyes are open
But you’re sleeping all the time
Dues-paying charter member
Slave to the bottom line

Got six televisions and a VCR
And a low percentage on the credit card
The Sega, Quadra and the Hi8
You entertain yourself into this state

The mild distractions
Keep you just so occupied
Dues-paying charter member
Slave to the bottom line

So snuff your candles all out
Just one at a time
Or do something dangerous and
Intensify your life

Now shake yourself awake, forget the white-noise-pumping hate
Make it so the glazed-eye drones are gonna mock you every day
You’ll make a perfect machine part if you just fit in with the plan
Pulse-pounding, pressure-mounting, get up and yell, “Shut that off!”
