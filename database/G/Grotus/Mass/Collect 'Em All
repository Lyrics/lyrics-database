Yea

Newspaper said he was a textbook case
A classic example of a mass killer
As a kid he was the judge in ant court, he even
Worked for the post office once

He got a car phone to yell in at no one in particular
Who would’ve noticed that it never rang?
He had a mono-brow and a big collection
Of .22s and .38s and .44s and 9s

Why should I wait all day in a line
To pay some fine?
While always hearing voices say
“Go get yours, ’cause I got mine”

Well, I’ll park anywhere that I want to
’Cause the mеter maid is dead
And I stamped “casе closed” on the rubble
Of the IRS man’s head

Well, his day started with his mother and his ex-something or other
A check list was later found
Suits and skirts splayed out all over the sidewalk
Green and gray and red, and how the pigeons fed

Sky full of copters, more cameras than copper
An adoring crowd swelled behind a giant barricade
Front page story, hah, now he’s immortal
A name memorized in households all across the USA

Got a place in a special history annal
And a life now not in vain
A card in the collector’s series
And John Rambo’s playing me

Well, I’ll park anywhere that I want to
’Cause the meter maid is dead
And I stamped “case closed” on the rubble
Of the IRS man’s head
