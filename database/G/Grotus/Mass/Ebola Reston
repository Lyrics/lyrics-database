No one plans for the unthinkable
Just the drive to move ahead
To cure the sick, to do what’s possible
You get the spare parts from a relative

And Ebola Reston should send a red flag up
But there’s no ticking sound
Step-by-step, inch-by-inch
Silent running always

Take a jungle beast that’s 98% the same
Kill the thing and part it out
And then control will look for bugs they know
But you can’t find what you’re not looking for

And Ebola Reston should send a red flag up
But there’s no ticking sound
Step-by-step, inch-by-inch
Silent running always

Ebola Reston is somewhere waiting
It might be in you now
