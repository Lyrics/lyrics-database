The shutter clicks
And the daydream mother fakes it
With the perfect shape
Designed for wanting

A nameless taste
Takes hold across the nation
The boys salivate
And all the girls ape it

Seasonally redefined
I try but cannot look away

Hourglass

But glossies fade
And the lens is paid to wander
As the sand shifts
From top to bottom

And the airbrushed grace
That kissed her face, finds a younger mate
And a million vets
Of manipulated passion wrinkle on

Sеasonally redefined
I cannot hеlp but look away

Hourglass
