And I have seen wonders
And I have seen miracles
Oh, I have seen some things
It’s all lost to me now
Like tears in the rain

(It’s all lost to me now)
(Like tears in the rain)

And I have seen sadness
And I have seen time run out
I’ve even seen men cry
It’s all lost to me now
Like tears in the rain

And my memories
I can’t give them away
So it’s easy
Like a long long sleep
I’m so tired
Now it’s my time to die

(Welcome home)
(Welcome home)

No exhibition
No screaming war songs
No conversation
No more opinions here

(It’s all lost to me now)
(Like tears in the rain)

And I have seen new wars
And I have seen things
That you wouldn’t believe
And I have seen my days
It’s all lost to me now
Like tears in the rain
