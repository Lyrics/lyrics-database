How can we do things so fast?
I didn’t know you
There was no way I’d be able to
Like you back

If I had just gave you time
I ran as soon as
The thought of us
Could cross my mind

But I killed it
I did it to myself
Oh, I killed it
I killed it, baby

I killed it
Da-dada-da-da-da
Da-da-da
I killed it

Self-induced friendzone
I like you now
And I’m going
Crazy

You’re going on with life
Knowing I turned you down
Why couldn’t I have just
Stayed and let it grow?

Oh, I killed it
I did it to myself
Oh, I killed it
I killed it, baby

I killed it
Da-dada-da-da-da
Da-da-da

I should have stuck around (I killed it, I did it to myself)
I could have fallen in love (I killed it)
You could’ve kept me from myself
You’re gone

Gone
Gone

I killed it
