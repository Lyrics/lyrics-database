I wanna fall hard and be on edge
I don’t wanna be in it so easy
Send me through the headaches of uncertainty
I’m hoping you can make my heart beat fast
Recently you’ve been so numb
You wanna chase each other down like it’s a game

I want the heart race when he leans in close
Let it almost happen
I want the taste of your eyes on my lips
Then pull away so I can wonder about it
Make me go mad about it, the what ifs

Make me mad that I want you around
This is different for me, baby
You know I’m always the one pulling the strings
I hope you know what you’re doing to me
It seems to me you do, honey
You’re playing the teasing games

You know for a fact I’ll stick around
If I can’t get you out of my head
So keep at it
Drag me through the mind games, do what you know best

I want the heart race when he leans in close
C’mon let it happen
I miss the what ifs and confusion
It keeps me interested
Don’t let me get bored of you

I want the taste of your eyes on my lips
Then pull away so I can wonder about it
Drag me through the headaches of uncertainty
You know for a fact
That I’ll stick around
If you can’t leave my head

You know for a fact I’ll stick around
If I can’t get you out of my head, oh baby
I miss the what ifs and confusion
You keep me interested
Don’t let me get bored of you
Don’t let me get bored of you
