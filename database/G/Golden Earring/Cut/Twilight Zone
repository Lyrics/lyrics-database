(Somewhere in a lonely hotel room there’s a guy starting to realize that his eternal fate has turn its back on him)
(It’s 2 a.m.)

It’s 2 a.m. (it’s 2 a.m.)
The fear has gone (the fear has gone)
I’m sittin’ here waitin’ (I’m sittin’ here waitin’)
The gun’s still warm (the gun’s still warm)
Maybe my connection is tired of takin’ chances?

Yeah, there’s a storm on the loose
Sirens in my head
Wrapped up in silence, all circuits are dead
Cannot decode, my whole life spins into a frenzy

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

I’m falling down a spiral, destination: unknown
Double-crossed messenger, all alone
Can’t get no connection, can’t get through
Where are you?

Well, the night weighs heavy on his guilty mind
This far from the borderline
When the hit man comes
He knows damn well he has been cheated

And he says

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Oh-oh

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone
Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Help, I’m steppin’ into the twilight zone
The place is a madhouse, feels like being cloned
My beacon’s been moved under moon and star
Where am I to go, now that I’ve gone too far?

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

Soon, you will come to know
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, ah-ha-ah
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, ah-ha-ah
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, ah-ha-ah
When the bullet hits the bone

When the bullet hits the bone, ah-ha-ah
When the bullet hits the bone
