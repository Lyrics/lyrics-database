I’ve been drivin’ all night, my hands wet on the wheel
There’s a voice in my head that drives my heel
It’s my baby callin’, sayin’, “I need you here”
And it’s a half past four and I’m shiftin’ gear

When she is lonely and the longing gets too much
She sends a cable, coming in from above
Don’t need no phone at all

We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
We’ve got a wave in the air
Radar love

The radio’s playin’ some forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s “Coming on Strong"
The road has got me hypnotized
And I’m speedin’ into a nude sunrise

When I get lonely and I’m sure I’ve had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don’t need no letter at all

We’ve got a thing that’s called a radar love
We’ve got a line in the sky
Radar love

No more speed, I’m almost there
Gotta keep cool, now gotta take care
Last car to pass, here I go!
And the line of cars go down real slow, woah

And the radio played that forgotten song
Brenda Lee’s “Coming on Strong”
And the newsman sang his same song
Oh, one more radar lover gone!

When I get lonely and I’m sure I’ve had enough
She sends her comfort coming in from above
We don’t need no letter at all

We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
We’ve got a line in the sky

We’ve got a thing that’s called radar love
We’ve got a thing that’s called
Radar love
