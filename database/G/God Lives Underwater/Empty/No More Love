I can see
See the signs
I’ve been waiting here for you
But nothing’s getting through

I am gone
Up in the clouds
Praying I can turn
Turn myself around

A year ago
I gave it a year
I hoped it wouldn’t happen
Now it’s here

It took so long
I can’t carry on
I know the reason that you left me
You had nothing more to give me

No more love
No more love

I can see
See your eyes
I can feel your heady stare
I run my fingers through my hair

I am high
As one can be
And I hope I don’t come down
I hate when I come down

A month ago
I know you lied
Took my life into your hands
You just don’t understand

How it feels
To be free
I know the reason that you left me
You had nothing more to give me

No more love
No more love

No more love
No more love

No more love
No more love

No more love
No more love

No more love
No more love
