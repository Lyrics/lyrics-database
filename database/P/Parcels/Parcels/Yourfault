I
I built a wall
I built it up
When I was young
I didn’t know
How could I know
I built it up?

It’s all gone
The family has moved on
And I don’t know if it’s
Your fault or my fault
It’s all gone
I know it now that I
Did wrong, but I don’t know if it’s
Your fault or my fault

You
You took a loan
You bought a house
And built it up
Oh
I’m sure you know
I felt alone
I couldn’t stop
(Stop)

It’s all gone
The family has moved on
And I don’t know if it’s
Your fault or my fault
It’s all gone
I know it now that I
Did wrong, but I don’t know if it’s
Your fault or my fault

It’s your fault.
