I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel now

I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel now

I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel now

I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel right now
I know how I feel now
I know how I feel now

I know how I feel but
oh, there’s a place I need to go,
over the end of every road,
where I can feel it on my own.
I know how I feel but
oh, where the race is all I know,
only the evening, let me go
where I can feel it on my own.

I know how you feel right now
I know how you feel right now
I know how you feel now

I know how you feel right now
I know how you feel right now
I know how you feel now
I know how you feel now
I know how you feel now

I know how you feel but
oh, there’s a place I need to go,
over the end of every road,
where I can feel it on my own.
I know how you feel but
oh, where the race is all I know,
only the evening, let me go
where I can feel it on my own.
