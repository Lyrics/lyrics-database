Time to lighten up?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to
Time I gave enough?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to

Every eye is on us
Every side is on us
“Sing it with pride and promise, never cry
Never cry, but you know we like it honest,
you know that’s why we bought you.
I like your style and all,
but do it right.
Do it in time.”

To lighten up?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to
Time I gave enough?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to

I need it, I love it.
The music, the time it takes for the letter to write back.
Let it go
Let it go, cause this is the final product
Drink it a while and call us
Sell it for dimes and dollars
There you go.

To lighten up?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to
Time I gave enough?
I don’t plan to
I don’t plan to
