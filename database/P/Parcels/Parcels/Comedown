No, no, no, no, no
When it all comes down
When it falls you can finda way out
When it all hits the ground
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Ooh, when it’s gone you can cry,
let it go and try
When it all comes down
Come down, come down, come down, come down

No, no, no, no, no
When it all comes down
When it falls you can finda way out
When it all hits the ground
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Ooh, when it’s gone you can cry,
let it go and try
When it all comes down
Come down, come down, come down, come down

Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down

Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
Come down, come down, come down, come down
