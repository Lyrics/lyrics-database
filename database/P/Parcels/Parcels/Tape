I lost my touch and I thought it was you
I lost my way cutting corners, faulty truth
So I went on my way to recapture what you took,
and I came back with tape.
Dare I leave it? Dare I look?

No way I can go wrong
It’s all there
I know the end
There’s no way out so so long
Oh man, not again

Do I retain yet a feeling over you?
And should I explain to the teacher? To my muse?
So I can get a break from the preacher, from a few
So I’ll go on and take what I need here, wouldn’t you?

No way I can go wrong
It’s all there
I know the end
There’s no way out so so long
Oh man, not again
