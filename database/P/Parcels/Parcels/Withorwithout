You were the world calling out my own name
You were the girl I fell beneath every day
You were the birds talking in my dream
You were the world I wish I’d never seen.

You were the line, drawn in every way
You were divine, even though I’d say
you were the start of something I don’t need
You were the world I wish I’d never seen.

With or without you?
With or without you?
With or without you?
Better without you.
Better without you.
Better without you.
With or without you?
Better without you.

Said I was more than a man in your way
Said I was yours till the end of the day
There was a time when I would have been
over the moon sinking on my knees.

You were the world calling out my own name
You were the girl I fell beneath every day
You were the birds talking in my dream
You were the world I wish I’d never seen.

With or without you?
With or without you?
With or without you?
Better without you.
Better without you.
Better without you.
With or without you?
Better without you.
