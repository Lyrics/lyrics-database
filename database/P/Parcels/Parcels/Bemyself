I know that I can’t be a few,
I’ll be myself
Be myself

I’m told to be over the moon,
I can teach myself
Teach myself

But I’m old, I can feel that it’s true
I believe myself
Believe myself

And I know it’ll be over soon,
I can see myself
See myself

(See myself, see myself) see myself
(See myself, see myself) see myself

I’m trapped, I am trapped in the boot
I can’t free myself
Free myself

And I’ll talk, but you know there’s no use
I can’t hear myself
Hear myself

The road’s blocked, I can tell that we’ve stopped
I will lead myself
Will lead myself

And I know if I’m moving or not
I will be myself
Be myself

(Be myself, by myself) be myself
(Be myself, by myself) be myself
(Be myself, by myself) be myself
(Be myself, by myself) be myself
