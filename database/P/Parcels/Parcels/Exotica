Your look
How it draws me in, a line I could never leave
Your eyes
Now I meet with them, it’s all that I’ll ever see
Your love
How I breath in it, it’s all I would ever need
I believe in it,
It’s all I could ever need

Oh mon amour, when you walk out the door
I’m more lost than before
And every night is another
Every night is another war
Lying alone but I love ya
I’ll never rewind what I never

Above
How I see it is
You will get a hold of it
The height
Heavens you design
In time you’ll do everything
Goodbye
What I hear of it
While I’m over on the other wing
While I’m over on the other wing

Oh mon amour, when you walk out the door
I’m more lost than before
And every night is another
Every night is another war
Lying alone but I love ya
I’ll never rewind what I never saw

Every night is another
Every night is another war
Lying alone but I love ya
I’ll never rewind what I never saw
