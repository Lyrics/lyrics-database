As I look out you’re warning me,
your thoughts devour my point of view
(Give you up now)
It’s true I cower when I will speak,
so let’s get round to why

I will be the first in line to open up,
so I don’t mind to give you up.

So let’s get round to why,
The one I need is tied up right now
So let’s just wait a while,
The one I need is tied up right now
So let’s not draw the line,
Cause I can’t make my mind up right now
So let’s just wait a while,
The one I need is tied up right

I will be the first in line to open up so I don’t mind
I will be the first in line to open up,
so I don’t mind to give you up.

So let’s get round to why,
The one I need is tied up right now
So let’s just wait a while,
The one I need is tied up right now
So let’s not draw the line,
Cause I can’t make my mind up right now

So let’s just wait a while,
The one I need is tied up right

Its unintended but all in vain
It’s what I found on my side
You knew I’d pass through it’s all the same,
So let’s get down to why

The one I need is tied up right now
So let’s just wait a while,
The one I need is tied up, right?
