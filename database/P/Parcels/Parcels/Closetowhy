All that waiting for a call
It arrived, and
I know that place seems kind of close

But I can’t sleep
I can’t seem to find
Waking peace of mind

The fight of the evening
Holds me close to why
I might never sleep at all
Even though I
Can’t seem to find
Waking peace of mind

Some might say my life’s a walk
In the light
and though I’d say the same, I don’t
’Cause all that space inside the walls
It’s alive
And all night shaking my resolve

So I can’t sleep
I can’t seem to find
Waking peace of mind

The fight of the evening
Holds me close to why
I might never sleep at all
Even though I
Can’t seem to find
Waking peace of mind
