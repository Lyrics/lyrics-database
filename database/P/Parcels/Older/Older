Show and you never will cover
What you own, honey, you own well
Holding it out will be tougher
As I know, honey, I know well
The thought is fulfilling a label
A token, honey, token known
It’s fake, though I know that you’re able
To see it honey, I see you well

Older
We want
Closure, you’re holding on tight
When your life is on
Hold
Neither
I don’t
I don’t want to leave you alone
I’m talking my mind as I’m torn
On and on…

Recalling the exchanged words
What you own, honey, you own well
The past is a world of retained hurt
as I know, honey, I know well.
You wonder the reason you changed for
A token, honey, token known
Time will escape, you can be sure
to see it, honey, I see you well

Older
We want
Closure, you’re holding on tight
When your life is on
Hold
Neither
I don’t
I don’t want to leave you alone
I’m talking my mind as I’m torn
On and on…

I don’t want to leave you alone
I’m talking my mind as I’m torn
On and on…
