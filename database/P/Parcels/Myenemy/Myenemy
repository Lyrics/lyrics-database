So fired up
Take a seat
So tied up
Only make believe
All my love
Take from me
All eyes up
But nothing there to see

And what I never touch
I see
And what’ll never touch me

I would’ve never thought
I’d be
My enemy

Cold enough
It’s shaking me
And it’s so tough
Just waiting patiently
So time’s up
It’s jading me
And so I must
Fight the time we keep

And what I never touch
I see
And what’ll never touch me

I would’ve never thought
I’d be
My enemy

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up
Fired up

So fired up
So fired up

My enemy
