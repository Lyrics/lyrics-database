I don’t want to be caught
In the middle
Taking all that I thought
And setting it off
Temporal moving forward
Its superficial
But always closing doors
But a ripple

I’m just here for
That girl
That girl
That girl
Would I kill for?
Not her
Not her
Not her

I’m just here for
That girl
That girl
That girl
Would I kill for?
Not her
Not her

I don’t want to be torn
In the middle
Its deafeningly unsure
Unofficial
But silently still we talk
Though a little
When timingly is no more
But a ripple

I’m just here for
That girl
That girl
That girl
Would I kill for?
Not her
Not her
Not her

I’m just here for
That girl
That girl
That girl
Would I kill for?
Not her
Not her

I’m just here for
That girl
That girl
That girl
Would I kill for?
Not her
Not her
Not her
