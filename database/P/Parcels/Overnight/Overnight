Go back
I want
So bad
To hold you back
It’s all I’ve said
And done

Fall in
Be gone
I will stand
As I’ve won again
The reason for
No more
Overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

Slow down
Never
I know now
I know better
I need it more
Than ever

Go back
Under
Hope that
I fall on the track
It’s all I’ve said
And done
Overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight

It’s overnight

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing

The minute I was thinking
To hold you back
The moment I was wishing
It’s overnight
