I never want to be
Stuck there, nowhere,
I’m caught
And I don’t want to be.
Locked there, upstairs,
No more.

So I got to go, got to get it out now.
Undertow, undertaking, over doubt.
Got to go, got to get it out now.

I never want to be
Stuck there, nowhere,
I’m caught.
It’s better not to be
Clock scared
Than off tier, no more.

It’s better not to be
Stuck there, nowhere,
No course.
Better not to be
Clock scared
Than off tier, no more.

So I got to go, got to get it out now.
Undertow, under, taking over doubt.
Got to go, got to get it out now.

Got to go, got to get it out now.
Undertow, undertaking, over doubt.
Got to go, got to get it out now.
