You know I can be the kind
To hide behind little lies
To tell you I’m sorry too much
Overthink till I’m mourning
Do you see that I’m growing?

Now I care some more
Now I care some more
Now I love someone
Now I love someone

And all that I’ve kept inside
The moment I made you cry
The way that you showed me how to touch
The way that you caught me
I know it’s a warning
I know that I’m falling

Now I care some more
Now I care some more
Now I love someone
Now I love someone

Now I care some more
Now I care some more
Now I love someone
Now I love someone (know that I’m scared)

Now I love someone
Now I love someone (know that I’m weak)

Now I love someone
Now I love someone (know that I’ll try)

Now I love someone
Now I love someone
