Is anyone out here,
Out on their own?
Is anyone listening now,
Out on the road?
This year’s
Been out of control.
Persevere
Till we find our way home.

Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
you just gotta keep coming back,
keep coming back for more and more.
Oh, you know, you know, you know
it’s so far better.
Just gotta keep on track,
keep coming back for more and more.

If anyone’s out here
Looking for hope,
If anyone gives a damn
I want you to know
I’m here,
You’re never alone.
Persevere
Till you find your way back home.

Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
you just gotta keep coming back,
keep coming back for more and more.
Oh, you know, you know, you know
it’s so far better.
Just gotta keep on track,
keep coming back for more and more.

Oh, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know
you just gotta keep coming back,
keep coming back for more and more.
Oh, you know, you know, you know
it’s so far better.
Just gotta keep on track,
keep coming back for more and more.
