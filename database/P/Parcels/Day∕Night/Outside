I’ve been outside
Hoping for something better
Holding my eyes
Holding myself together
And even on that island
Heard my mother’s wedding bells
I’ve been so tired
I’ve been so tired

I’ve been alone
Walking those streets forever
Holding my phone
Wait to receive a letter
And I’m gonna see my father
Gonna ask him something else
Where did you go?

But everything’s cool here
I don’t want to ruin this party
Everybody’s cool here
I don’t want to ruin your party

Isn’t that nice
What an old man can tell ya
Ain’t it just cruel
What your old ma remembers
I don’t want to be my father
But I don’t want to be alone
How can I hide?
How can I know?

So I’ve been alone
Writing you songs and letters
I’ve been alone
Feels like I might forever
I’ve been living on that island
But it’s time to let it go
I’ve been so scared
I feel so alone

But everything’s cool here
I don’t want to ruin this party
Everybody’s cool here
I don’t want to ruin your party
