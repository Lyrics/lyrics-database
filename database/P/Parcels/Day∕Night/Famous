Don’t go thinking why
You’re living a lie
Now there’s a lot to earn
Dead or alive
(Alive, Alive)
They told you what you want
You never decide
(It’s decided)
Just hold on and you might

Be famous (famous)
Your way to paradise
Be famous (famous)
Your way to all delight
Just taste it (taste it)
Just taste the sugar high
Just taste it (taste it)

You don’t go thinking life
Had ever been kind
You found there’s a lot to burn
You let it collide
(Collide, Collide)
You just threw in the dice
And let em decide
(It’s decided)
But now you’re thinking why

You’re famous (famous)
Your way to paradise
You’re famous (famous)
Your way to all delight
But you’re tasteless (tasteless)
’Cause taste don’t feed your high
’Cause you’ve made it (made it)

(Famous, famous)
(Famous, famous)

You’re famous (famous)
Your way to paradise
You’re famous (famous)
Your way to all delight
But you’re tasteless (tasteless)
’Cause taste don’t feed your high
’Cause you’ve made it (made it)
