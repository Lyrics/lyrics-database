See the morning hour
Glowing just like honey
All of the clouds are born here
Ripening to a storm

Here I am in motion
Floating out to sea
Deep within all this water
I’m beginning to breath

Holding on is breaking a part of me
I lost when I went overseas
I lost when I thought you were being loved
Holding on is taking a toll on me
I lost when I thought that’s the feeling love
When that’s the feeling lust

Lean into the open
Take me to the beach
Show me a way to love this
All that is just a moment
All that can never last

Holding on is breaking a part of me
I lost when I went overseas
I lost when I thought you were being loved
Holding on is taking a toll on me
I lost when I thought that’s the feeling love
When that’s the feeling lust
