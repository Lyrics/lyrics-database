Another night
I want to get out
I want to get high again

Another night
Another let down
Another cold count to ten

But you and I
We never made sense
We never had time to care

Another night
Don’t want to find out
Don’t want to define the fear

You and I
We never made sense
We never had time to care

Another night
Don’t want to find out
Don’t want to define the fear
