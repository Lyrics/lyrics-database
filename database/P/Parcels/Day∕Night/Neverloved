Quiet in the darkest hour
Lies underneath the ground
Diving between the towers
Hiding from the sound

I never loved her
I’ve never loved
I never loved her

Leaving this lie
Leaving this dream
I’m leaving tonight and I can’t be seen
I’m taking the moment
Giving up my past
I’m gonna reach up for what’s gonna last

I never loved her
(All day, all night)
I’ve never loved
(Together, in fright)
I never loved her
(Everything’s, alright)
I’ve never loved
(Till we kiss goodnight)

Living so large
Living week to week
I’ve got to say I love the way it is
And baby you’re perfect
On every side
Just got a feeling I can’t deny

I never loved her
(All day, all night)
I’ve never loved
(Together, in fright)
I never loved her
(Everything’s, alright)
I’ve never loved
(Till we kiss goodnight)
