Dance with me
Take me by the hand and see
We can have it all
We can fuel the fire
We can rule the world
We can go to war

Taste it all
Taking what we need and more
We can have it all

All the love
All the lies
You can have it all
Every pearl you wear
Every golden hair
You can have it all

Never age
Never die
You can have it all

You can have it all

You can have it all

You can have it all
