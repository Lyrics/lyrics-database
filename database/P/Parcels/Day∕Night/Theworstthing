Here I am again
Waiting for a call
This time it ain’t coming
And I know I’m gonna walk
Back to her again
Waiting for a lie
Waiting for another one
Another way to waste my time

And even though I do not care
I wish that I would have you here
I wish that I could still believe
The love that once you gave to me
And even though I am alright
I wish I didn’t see the light
The best thing I could ever find
The worst thing I would ever find

Here I am again
Looking for a line
Looking for a warmer way
Another glass of wasted wine
And yes there’s someone else
Yes I’m feeling fine
Yes, yes, never better
It’s not even on my mind

But even though I do not care
I wish that I would have you here
I wish that I could still believe
The love that once you gave to me
And even though I am alright
I wish I didn’t see the light
The best thing I could ever find
The worst thing I would ever find
