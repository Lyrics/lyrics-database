We’ve been enough, we’ve seen enough
We’ve lived it up and had to stop
We’re beaten up, we’re beaten up
We’re beaten up and had it tough
Im near enough, your near enough
We’re at the point of giving up
We’re giving up, We’re given up, We’re giving up

I’m deep in love
Is it all that kind?
To leave a love for a new taste
The scene of us
With an old point of view
I need a lot
But never really knew

I feel this need
To be free
Can we feel
And be real

I need your love
But can I breath this time?
Cause I see your love in a new way
Am I deep enough
To see through you

I feel this need to be free
Can we feel and be real?
I feel this need to be free
Can we feel and be free?

I’m clearin up, I’m clearin up
I’m clearer to what happens but
I’m giving up, I’m giving up
I’m giving up and now it’s time for me
To love, me to love
Once you see the need to love
A deeper love, a deeper love, a deeper love

I feel this need to be free
Can we feel and be real?

I feel this need
