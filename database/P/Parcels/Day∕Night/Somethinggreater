When I met you
I was just a child
Working through
Fears of the night
Then you flew
Over to my side
And then I knew
It had always been right

To give
To love
To stay
In touch
To give
Enough
To love

Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone

Now I’m leaving you
For the both of us
To find something new
Cause were not enough
And all I can do
Is to know

That we
Could meet
Again
Sometime
When we
Could be
The end

Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone

Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone
Until it lasts forever
Until it lasts so long
Until we’re back together
I’ll be alone

Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else
Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else

Until it lasts forever (holding out)
Until it lasts so long (for something greater)
Until we’re back together (holding out)
I’ll be alone (for something else)
Until it lasts forever (holding out)
Until it lasts so long (for something greater)
Until we’re back together (holding out)
I’ll be alone (for something else)

Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else
Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else

Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else
Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else

Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else
Holding out
For something greater
Holding out
For something else
