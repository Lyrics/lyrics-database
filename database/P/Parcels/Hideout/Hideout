I close the door to all that I am.
I called a lie, I told you all I’ve said.
I failed even more than I understand,
it’s coming out of every wall I mend.

You know that I keep my mind on
A note that I keep hiding so long
my love, so long.

’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is
’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is

Time tells me more of who that I am,
I’ll kneel to all that will release my hand.
I talk to the floor, I fight to pretend.
You think that I will reach a point to mend?

You know that I keep my mind on
A note thatI keep hiding
So long, my love, so long.

’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is
’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is

’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is
’Cause you know that I keep a hide out
and all that I’m thinking about is
