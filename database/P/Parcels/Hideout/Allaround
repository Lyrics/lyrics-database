I sleep to dawn.
You and I, I recall
So I might adore a timed arrival

Try re-report
every line, every wall.
So I might adore a timed arrival.

You wanted us to be
You wanted all alone
You didn’t have to leave
You didn’t have to go.

Why wait a while
when the woe won’t resign?
I’ll wait in line at the border.

So spy, waste your time,
make a show of what you find.
I’ll just wait in line at the border.

You wanted us to be
You wanted all alone
You didn’t have to leave
You didn’t have to go.
