You sowed it slower to find your man
but folding over won’t hide your hand

’cause you waited long enough
hesitated over love
now you’re taking over us

’cause you waited long enough
hesitated over love
now you’re taking over

Ha, ooh, I can’t just believe it
Ha, ooh, I can not receive that
Ha, ooh, I can’t just believe it

The strongest shoulder won’t hold you up
and cold October won’t call your bluff

’cause you make it dangerous
when you’re playing games of luck
now you’re taking over us

’cause you make it dangerous
when you’re playing games of luck
now you’re taking over
Us

Ha, ooh, I can’t just believe it
Ha, ooh, I can not receive that
Ha, ooh, I can’t just believe it
