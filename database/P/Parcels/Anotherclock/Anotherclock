Stop, you’re giving it
I’m not getting it.
Stop I’m not getting it.
Another clock, its upsetting it,
Its upsetting my soul.
Oh I want back again.
But I don’t mind,
I’m not taking on.
Luck, it gets imminent.
Fuck, I’m not digging it.,
I’m not getting it wrong.

Time will wait for you
When its all been done
But we’re all too young.
The time we’ve taken to
Let it all be done
Has an open sum.
Time will wait for you.

You’re not fitting it,
You’re just kicking in doors.
Show a little remorse.
Now you’re not wishing it,
There’s no wishing it was.
You don’t listen no more.

Time will wait for you
When its all been done
But we’re all too young.
The time we’ve take to
Let it all be done
Hasn’t opened some.
Time will wait for you…
