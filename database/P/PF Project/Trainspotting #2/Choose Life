Choose your future

Choose life

Choose life,
Choose a job,
Choose a career,
Choose a family,
Choose a fucking big television.
Choose washing machines, cars,
Compact disc players, and electrical tin openers.
Choose leisure wear and matching luggage.
Choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics.
Choose DIY and wondering who you are on a Sunday morning.
Choose sitting on that couch,
Watching mind-numbing
Sprit-crushing game shows,
Stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth.
Choose rotting away at the end of it all,
Pushing you last in a miserable home
Nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish,
Fucked-up brats you have spawned to replace yourself.

Choose your future
Choose life

I chose not to choose life
I chose something else

Choose your future

Choose life

Choose life

Choose your future

Choose life

I chose something else

Choose your future

Choose your future
Choose life
