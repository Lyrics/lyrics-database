If I could
I would take a tree branch
And ram it inside you
But it’s already been done

If I could
I would take a tree branch
And ram it inside you
But it’s already been done

If I could
I would take a tree branch
And ram it inside you
Splitting open
Your heart of palm
But it’s already been done
From spoiled plantains
Crawls out
Tarantula
