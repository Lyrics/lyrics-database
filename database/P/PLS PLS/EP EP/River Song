I took you down to the river tonight
And I watched your body float out to sea
I went along for the one-way ride
C’mon little girl, come and rescue me

I took you down to the river tonight
And I watched your body float out to sea
I had a feeling something wasn’t right
It was the sound of the river that brought you to me

I was along for an earlier whirl
But I knew somebody had to take me home
I got lost in the rising tide
And in the half-light all mistakes are gone

I took you down to the river tonight
And I watched your body float out to sea
I had a feeling something wasn’t right
It was the sound of the river that brought you to me

I was along for an earlier whirl
But I knew somebody had to take me home
I got lost in the rising tide
And in the half-light all mistakes are gone
