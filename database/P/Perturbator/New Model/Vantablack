Poisonous eyes
Lay your poisonous eyes on me
And taint me if you dare
Yeah, taint me if you’re so smart

Scotch and soda in my blood
Where can I get some more?

I’m taking you home
I’m taking you home
I’m making a point
I’m taking you…

Please allow me to play
With my shiny stainless blade
And stroke your marble skin
And feel the steel slide between your thighs

Hush
You are not leaving this couch
Shut up
Or I’ll smash every tooth in your mouth

Let me do a little dance
Let me show you some romance
Let me be your gentleman
Let me put on some jazz
Let me fetch some candles
Let me turn up the heat
Let me light a Partagas
Let me tie your ankles
Let me treat you like a queen

The pulse
The pulse in your throat
The pulse
The pulse in your throat
Beating louder now
Beating faster now
Beating faster now

...
Pressing my fingers
Deeper, ever deeper
Into the flesh of your neck
Into the flesh of your neck

Panting
Both of us panting
Panting
The pulse in your throat
The pulse in your throat
Beating slower now
Beating slower now
Beating slower now
