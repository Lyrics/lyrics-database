Walk
A million miles away
When you talk
I don’t hear what you say

Wouldn’t let me in
To the state you’re in
No difference to this town
No sympathy found

In a lonely city
I can’t be around
So safe and sound
So safe and sound

Run
A thousand times a day
Pretty one
They never let you stay

In the land of sin
There’s a dead leaf wind
No difference to this town
You’re refugee bound

In a lonely city
I can’t be around
So safe and sound
So safe and sound

No reverence to this crown
No remedy found
No difference to this town
You’re refugee bound

In a lonely city
I can’t be around
It will tear you up
Before it tears you down

Heaven dreams
That you’re safe and sound
So safe and sound
So safe and sound

So safe and sound
So safe and sound
