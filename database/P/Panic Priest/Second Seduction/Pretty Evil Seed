Take a long, hard
Look at what you have done
You’ve torn apart
Another warm heart
With this game that you won
Right from the start

Like a child you kill your plaything
With curiosity
Then justify most anything
To satiate your need

’Cause
You’re a lot like me
My pretty evil seed
A lot like me
You’re born to be set free
You will eventually
Reveal your true nature to be
A lot like me
My pretty evil seed

Give it some time
It will bloom into dust
Then fall apart
Little dove cry
When the promise of lust
Outweighs your trust

Like a wild and shrill
Untamed thing
With pure ferocity
You satisfy your every need
To satiate your greed

’Cause
You’re a lot like me
My pretty evil seed
A lot like me
You’re born to be set free
You will eventually
Reveal your true nature to be
A lot like me
My pretty evil seed

C’mon

(you hide behind your friendly eyes)
(that sympathize)
(while you terrorize)

A lot like me
My pretty evil seed
A lot like me
You’ll burn eternally
And you’ll forever be
A slave to every wanton need
A lot like me

Oh just you wait and see
Oh just you wait and see
Now just you wait and see
My pretty evil seed
