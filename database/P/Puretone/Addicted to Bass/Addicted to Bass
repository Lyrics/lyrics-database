I got two pale hands up against the window pane
I’m shaking with the heat of my need again
It starts in my feet, reverbs up to my brain
There’s nothing I can do to revert the gain

I’m looking down to the street below
There’s nothing in the way they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too, hunger for the beast below

Listening to the radio I feel so out of place
There’s a certain-something missing that the treble can’t erase
I know you can tell just by looking at my face
A word about my weakness, I’m totally addicted to bass

Wow-woah-ow

Wow-woah-ow

There’s nothing I can do to be cool
I don’t sleep ’til I’ve had my fuel
It frustrates if I am deprived
A hunger that grates from deep inside

I feel like I’m doing time
Imprisoned by dependence on a rhythm sublime
In my mind I must overcome the need to define
The solitary silence of a faceless crime

Standing by the stereo, I’m feeling so alone
My back against a speaker, and I’m moving on my own
Surrounded by so many, and they’re staring at my face
They’re picking up my problem, I’m totally addicted to bass

Wow-woah-ow

(Your bassline is shooting up my spine)
Wow-woah-ow
(Your bassline has got me feeling fine)
(It’s filling up my mind)

Sunrise at my window, I look down on the street
People I see everywhere are tapping their feet
Suddenly I realise in a look that I was wrong
Everybody’s groovin’ to their own song

Down at the scene below
There’s something in the way they move to show
They too, know what I know
They too, hunger for the beast below

Rhythm’s running over me to wash away my fears
The backbeat of humanity sweetens my tears
There’s something that’s connected us down throughout the years
No need to feel so lonely, everyone’s addicted to bass

Wow-woah-ow

Wow-woah-ow (wow-woah-ow)

(Your bassline is shooting up my spine)
(Your bassline)
(Your bassline has got me feeling fine)
(It’s filling up my mind)

(Your bassline is shooting up my spine)

Wow-woah-ow

(Your bassline has got me feeling fine)
(It’s filling up my mind)

(Your bassline is shooting up my spine)
Wow-woah-ow
(Your bassline has got me feeling fine)
(It’s filling up my mind)

(Your bassline is shooting up my spine)
(Your bassline)
