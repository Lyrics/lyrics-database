There’s a bump in the basement
There’s a knocking on the wall
In the pumping of the pistons
I swear I heard you call

There’s a bump in the basement
There’s a hole in the floor
There’s a guard in the garden
Locking up the door

There’s a rumble in the floorboards
No shutting out the sound
And the workers down below me
Digging underground

Feel the building all around me
Like a wrap of armoured skin
But the more we are protected
The more we’re trapped within

We’re building up and up.
We’re building up and up.
We’re building up and up.
We’re building up and up, ’til we can touch the sky.

Tell it like it is
’Til there’s no misunderstanding
When you strip it right back
Man feed machine, machine feed man

Tell it like it is (and on this land, we cast our fortune)
Till there’s no misunderstanding (and on this ground, we make our home)
You make up what you like
Man feed machine, machine feed man

Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
Brick-by-brick-by-brick-by-brick we’re building
