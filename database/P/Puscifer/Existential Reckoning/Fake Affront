Heard it all before
Shut up (shut the fuck up)
Whinge and bleat, baby, we’ve heard it all before
Shut up (shut the fuck up)
Whinge and bleat, baby, we’ve heard it all before

Sanctimonious, phony little shit
You can drop the fake affront, pompous ass
Heard it all before

(Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooh) (shut the fuck up)
(Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooh) (shut the fuck up)

Pious lipstick, smeared fundamentalism
Drop the fake affront, pompous ass
Heard it all before

(Heard it all, shut the fuck up)
(Heard it all, heard it all, all, heard it all)
(Shut the fuck up)
(Heard it all, hеard it—)

Far right, far left, same shit
You can drop the fakе affront, pompous ass
Heard it all before

(Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooh)
(Heard it all before)
(Ha-ha-ha)
(Heard it all, heard it)
(Ha-ha-ha)
(Heard it all, heard it)
(Ha-ha-ha)
(Heard it all, heard it)
(Ha-ha-ha)
(Heard it all, heard it)

(Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooh)
(Hoo-ooo-ooo-ooh)
