Whether near or far
I am always yours
Any change in time
We are young again

Lay us down
We’re in love
Lay us down
We’re in love

Oh, oh, oh, oh

In these coming years
Many things will change
But the way I feel
Will remain the same

Lay us down
We’re in love
Lay us down
We’re in love

Oh, oh, oh, oh
