Stop stalling, make a name for yourself
Boy you better put that pen to paper, charm your way out
If you talk you better walk you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you’re all under the gun

Start talking "a sensationalist"
Oh he’s slightly clever to just a certain extent
If you talk you better walk you better keep your mouth shut
With more than good hooks while you’re all under the gun

(Panic!: meet the press)
It’s time for us to take a chance
It’s time for us to take a chance

(Panic!: meet the press)
It’s time for us to take a chance
It’s time for us…

Well we’re just a wet dream for the webzine,
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don’t approve a single word that we wrote

Well we’re just a wet dream for the webzine,
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
Or shrug us off your shoulders
Don’t approve a single word that we wrote

I’m burning and I’m blacking my lungs
Boy you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue
If you talk you better walk you better back your shit up
With more than good hooks while you’re all under the gun

Start talking "a sensationalist"
Oh he’s slightly clever to just a certain extent
Well keep quiet let us sing like the doves
Then decide if it’s done with purpose or lack thereof

Just for the record,
The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of:
A. Indifference or
B. Disinterest in what the critics say

It’s time for us to take a chance
It’s time for us…

Well we’re just a wet dream for the webzine,
Make us it, make us hip, make us scene
