Gone are the days we used to run into the night
Oh what I’d give to do it one last time
Against the odds with you by my side
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]
I felt so alive (felt so alive, felt so alive)
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we’d crossed anyway
Are you looking for something more? (one careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers
Behind these eyes it all leads to you

Now you’ve turned your back on all of us
Everything we had has turned to dust
These fractured minds and countless lies
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]
Will be the end of us (will be the end of us, will be the end of us)
[Turned your back, turned your back on all of us, turned your back on me]

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we’d crossed anyway
Are you looking for something more? (One careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers
Behind these eyes it all leads to you

Now that you’ve gone, I’m going to take what is left
And now that you’ve gone, I’m going to walk to the edge

One careless kiss, two fallen lovers
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers
One careless kiss, two fallen lovers

Do we leave it behind, do we just walk away?
Drawing lines in the sand that we’d crossed anyway
Are you looking for something more? (One careless kiss)
Two fallen lovers
Behind these eyes it all leads to you
