I cannot hide my tearful eyes
I cannot stand you start to cry
No chance to change my mind

A thousand voices in my head
Nothing I could understand
How could a boy feel so alone?

Now I play my favourite song
It does not change, I feel alone
I tried to reach your lonely heart

Still I stay here at this place
Although I know I lost my race
No chance to be with you again

I see you walking down the street
Can’t you see how much I bleed?
After all it was you and me

Cannot stand we’re losing time
Without a love that means a crime
After all it was you and me

You and me
You and me
You and me

Who has left me with those tears?
Heavy weight of words to bear
I always knew I was telling lies

Is there anything I could do?
I really lost my love to you
No excuses offered anyway

I see you walking down the street
Can’t you see how much I bleed?
After all it was you and me

I cannot stand we’re losing time
Without a love that means a crime
After all it was you and me

You and me
You and me
You and me

I see you walking down the street
Can’t you see how much I bleed?
After all it was you and me

Cannot stand we’re losing time
Without a love that means a crime
After all it was you and me

I see you walking down the street
Can’t you see how much I bleed?
After all it was you and me

Cannot stand we’re losing time
Without a love that means a crime
After all it was you and me

You and me
You and me
You and me
