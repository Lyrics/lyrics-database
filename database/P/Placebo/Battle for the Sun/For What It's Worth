The end of the century
I said my goodbyes

For what it’s worth

I always aimed to please
But I nearly died

For what it’s worth

Come on lay with me
’Cause I’m on fire

For what it’s worth

I’d tear the sun in three
To light up your eyes

For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth

Broke up the family
Everybody cried

For what it’s worth

I have a slow disease
That sucked me dry

For what it’s worth

Come on walk with me
Into the rising tide

For what it’s worth

Filled a cavity
Your God-shaped hole tonight

For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth
For what it’s worth

No one cares when you’re out on the street
Picking up the pieces to make ends meet
No one cares when you’re down in the gutter
Got no friends, got no lover

No one cares when you’re out on the street
Picking up the pieces to make ends meet
No one cares when you’re down in the gutter
Got no friends, got no lover

For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover
For what it’s worth
Got no lover

Got no friends, got no lover
