Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages
Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages

I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by
I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by

Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages
Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages

I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by
I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Start again, start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again

Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again

Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages
Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages

Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages
Always stays the same, nothing ever changes
English summer rain seems to last for ages

I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by
I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by

I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by
I’m in the basement, you’re in the sky
I’m in the basement baby, drop on by

Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Start again, start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
Then fall apart and start again
Hold your breath and count to ten
And start again, and start again

Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
Start again
