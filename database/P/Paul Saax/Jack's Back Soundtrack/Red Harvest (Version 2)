Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Dancing high upon a ledge
Her laughter raining down
All of these falling leaves
The leaves wither and turn brown

Fate has brought us to this place
Come and take my hand
Years will come and go
Mountains crumble into sand

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Stars forsake me!
A cold wind shakes me down
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Where can I run?

Red harvest comes
