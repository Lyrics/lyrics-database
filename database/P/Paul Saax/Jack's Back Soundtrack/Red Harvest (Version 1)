Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Had a dream one night
Of a ship breaking free
You stood on the shore
Watched me drifting off to sea

Every now and then
A wave of sadness covered me
A century of sleep
Can’t erase the memory

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Stars forsake me!
A cold wind shakes me
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes
Red harvest comes
Where can I run?
Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes

Red harvest comes
