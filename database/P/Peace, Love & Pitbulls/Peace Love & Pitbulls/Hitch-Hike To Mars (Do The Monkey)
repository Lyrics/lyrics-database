Monkeys like me eat
Bananas and speed
Monkeys like me dig the
Houdini scene

Monkeys
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me never
Never fall asleep

Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike
Hitch-hike to Mars

Monkeys like me feel
Trapped in a cage
Monkeys like me think of
Nothing but escape

Monkeys like me
Know there's no place like space


Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike
Hitch-hike to Mars

Don't you wanna leave
Don't you wanna leave
Don't you wanna leave this place
And hitch-hike
Hitch-hike to Mars?

Don't you wanna leave
Don't you wanna leave
Don't you wanna leave this place
And hitch-hike
Hitch-hike to Mars?

Monkey
Monkey
Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me

Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike, hitch-hike to Mars

Aw!

Monkeys
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me never
Never fall asleep

Monkey
Monkey
Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me
Do the Monkey with me
