Monkeys like me eat
Bananas and speed
Monkeys like me dig the
Houdini scene

Monkeys
Monkeys like me
Monkeys like me never
Never fall asleep

Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike, hitch-hike to Mars

Monkeys like me feel
Trapped in a cage
Monkeys like me think of
Nothing but escape

Monkeys like me
Know there’s no place like space, yea!

Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike to Mars

Don’t you wanna leave?
Don’t you wanna leave?
Don’t you wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike?
Don’t you wanna leave?
Don’t you wanna leave?
Don’t you wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike, hitch-hike to Mars?

Monkey!
Monkey!
Do the Monkey with me!
Monkey!
Monkey!
Do the Monkey with me!

Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
Hitch-hike to Mars
I just wanna leave this world
And hitch-hike, hitch-hike to Mars
