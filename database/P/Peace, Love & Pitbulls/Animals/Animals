Animal instinct, animal high
Animal kisses, animalized
Animal me, animal you
Animal-hungry, feed me tonight

Animals

Animal city, animal streets
Animal centuries, second-hand breed
Animal woman, animal man
Everyone's happy in animal land

Animals
Animals
Animals, hungry
Hungry

Animal skin makes animal lust
Animal wired, animal must
Animal naked, animal rights
Babylon’s burnin’ and I’m animal-wild

Animals
Animals
Animals
Animals

Animal cages, animal tribes
Animal faces, dehumanized
Animal flesh, animal jaws
Animal bodies crawling the floor

Animal hungry, feed me tonight
Animal hungry, hungry, hungry

Animal cages, animal tribes
Animal faces, dehumanized
Animal flesh, animal jaws
Animal bodies crawlin’ the floor

Animal city animal streets
Animal centurys. second hand breed
Animal woman. animal man
Everyones happy in animal land

Animal hungry, feed me tonight
Animal hungry, hungry, hungry
