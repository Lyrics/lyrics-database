Animal instinct, animal high
Animal kisses, animalized
Animal me, animal you
Animal-hungry, feed me tonight

Animals

Animal city, animal streets
Animal centuries, second-hand breed
Animal woman, animal man
Everyone’s happy in animal land

Animals
Animals
Animals, hungry
Hungry

Animal skin makes animal lust
Animal-wired, animal must
Animal-naked, animal rights
Babylon’s burnin’ and I’m animal-wild

Animals
Animals
Animals
Animals

Animal instinct, animal high
Animal kisses, animalized
Animal me, animal you
Animal-hungry, animal-wild

Animals
Animals
Animals
Hungry

Animal-hungry, feed me tonight
Animal-hungry, ...
Animal-hungry, feed me tonight
Animal-hungry, hungry, hungry

Animals
Animals
Animals
I'm hungry

Hungry
Hungry
Hungry
Hungry
