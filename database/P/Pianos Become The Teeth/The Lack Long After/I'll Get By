I used to listen to my life,
I was so put together,
I chose what I wanted to be in that age of chasing sand,
The age of believing in everything,
But I couldn’t save you,
I couldn’t save what was taken away,
And I’m still singing, and you still can’t stay.
You "loved life," and those words have lasted,
I just wish I would have had ears for more than what you said
Because I still feel the lack long after.
Such a light body, such a quiet gait leaving behind the weight of the world,
I’ll always think it was too early to lose your shine,
I guess the means that ends us means nothing,
I just hope it’s the peace we all need,
Because I could love and drown in your God damned smile lines,
But I think I burnt up watching you rallying to stay alive,
And I guess that’s fine.
It seems we all get sick,
We all die in some no name hospital with the same colored walls,
And I guess that’s fine,
But I want to swallow, I want to stomach, I want to live.
It’s been a rough while and some days are worse than others,
There’s no proper way to feel, no mirth, no levity, no amazing grace,
Just a flame on a lake floating away,
I can’t let you lay,
I want you to know, I’m learning patience against my will,
I want you to know, I’ll get by, always barely scraping
With just a hunger, with just a heart apart,
It’s a hell of a thing.
