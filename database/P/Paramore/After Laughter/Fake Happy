I love making you believe
What you get is what you see
I'm so fake happy
Feel so fake happy
I'll bet everybody here
Is just as insincere
We're all so fake happy
I know fake happy

So I've been doing a good job
Of makin' them think
I'm quite alright
Better hope I don't blink
You see, it's easy when I'm stompin' on a beat
But no one sees me when I crawl back underneath
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

If I go out tonight
And dress up my fears
You think I look alright with these mascara tears?
See, I'm gonna draw up my lipstick wider than my mouth
And if the lights are low they'll never see me frown
Hey, if I smile with my teeth
Bet you believe me
If I smile with my teeth
I think I believe me

Oh, please, don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, oh, oh what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too

I know I said that I was doing good and that I'm happy now
(Ooh, ooh)
I shoulda known when things were going good
That's when I'd get knocked down

Oh, please, just don't ask me how I've been
Don't make me play pretend
Oh no, (oh no), oh what's the use?
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
Oh, please
Oh, please
Oh, please, I bet everybody here is fake happy too
