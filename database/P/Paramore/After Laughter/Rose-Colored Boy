Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather

Rose-colored boy
I hear you making all that noise
About the world you want to see
And oh, I'm so annoyed
'Cause I just killed off what was left of
The optimist in me
But hearts are breaking
And wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
I'm right at the end of my rope
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll choke

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile
If I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause
'Cause I've been through a lot
Really all I've got, is just to stay pissed off
If it's all right by you
But hearts are breaking
And wars are raging on
And I have taken my glasses off
You got me nervous
And you're turning it into a joke
A half-empty girl
Don't make me laugh, I'll

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile
If I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Leave me here a little bit longer
I think I wanna stay in the car
I don't want anybody seeing me cry now
You say, "We gotta look on the bright side"
I say, "Well maybe if you wanna go blind"
You say my eyes are getting too dark now
But boy you ain't ever seen my mind

Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile
If I don't want to
Hey man, we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy
Just let me cry a little bit longer
I ain't gon' smile
If I don't want to
I know we all can't be like you
I wish we were all rose-colored too
My rose-colored boy

Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
Low-key, no pressure
Just hang with me and my weather
