You hurt me bad this time
No coming back
And I cried 'till I couldn't cry
Another heart attack
If I lay on the floor, maybe I'll wake up
And I don't pick up when you call
'Cause your voice is a gun
Every word is a bullet hole, shot a hole in the sun
If I never look up, maybe I'll never notice

And you, you want forgiveness
But I, I just can't do it yet

There's still a thread that runs from your body to mine
And you can't break what you don't see, an invisible line
If I follow it down, would we just be alright
But it could take me all your life to learn to love
How I thought I could love someone
I haven't even begun
If it's all up to us, we might as well give up

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I just can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)

Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
Don't you go and get it twisted
Forgiving is not forgetting
No, it's not forgetting
No, I'll never forget it, no

And you, you want forgiveness
(I can barely hang on to myself)
But I, I can't give you that
(I can't give you, I can't give you that)
And you, you want forgiveness
(I'm afraid that I'll have nothing left)
But I, I just can't do it yet
(I can't do, I just can't do it yet)
