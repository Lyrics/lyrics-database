I can't think of gettin' old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry
Can't look back
Can't look too far ahead
I got the point, I got the message

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

I was dreaming life away
All the while just going blind
Can't see the forest for the trees
Behind the lids of my own eyes
Nostalgia's cool, but it won't help me now
The dream is good, (don't wear it out)
If you don't wear it out

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle

No, I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no help
I can sabotage me by myself
I don't need no one else
I can sabotage me by myself

And I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
I try to keep going but it's not that simple
I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
I gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
Yeah, I'm caught in the middle
I'm caught in the middle
