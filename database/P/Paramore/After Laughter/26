Man, you really know
How to get someone down
Everything was fine
Until you came around
And I've been chasin' after dreamers in the clouds
After all, wasn't I the one who said
To keep your feet on the ground
Man, you really brought me back down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreamin' is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

You got me tied up
But I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
Hopin' someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you said
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down

Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreamin' is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me

Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died
So let it break your heart

And hold onto hope if you got it
And don't let it go for nobody
Hold onto hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
And they say that dreamin' is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
