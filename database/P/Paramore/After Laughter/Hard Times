All that I want
Is to wake up fine
Tell me that I'm alright
That I ain't gonna die
All that I want
Is a hole in the ground
You can tell me when it's alright
For me to come out

(Hard times)
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times)
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives)
And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta get to rock bottom (ooh)

Walking around
With my little rain cloud
Hanging over my head
And it ain't comin' down
Where do I go
Gimme some sort of sign
You hit me with lightning
Maybe I'll come alive

(Hard times)
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times)
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives)
And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times)
(Hard times)
And I gotta hit rock bottom (ooh)

Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
Tell my friends I'm coming down
We'll kick it when I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground
When I hit the ground

(Hard times)
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times)
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives)
And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times)
Gonna make you wonder why you even try
(Hard times)
Gonna take you down and laugh when you cry
(These lives)
And I still don't know how I even survive
(Hard times) Hard times
(Hard times)

Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder why you even try
Makes you wonder
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how I even survive
Still don't know how (I survive)
And I gotta get to rock bottom (ooh)
