Strange how we found ourselves exactly where we left off
I know you're shaking my hand like it's the first time
Are we alright?
Are you recounting all my faults?
And are you racking your brain just to find them all?
Could it be that I've changed or did you?
(Wooh!)

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Time is a bastard, I won't break my neck to get around it
But aren't we so brave to give up a fight
And let the years go by without us
'Cause now I feel you by my side
And I don't even care if it's been a while
I can feel that we've changed and we're better this way
(Wooh!)

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
If you wanna call me up or come over
Come on, we'll laugh 'till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges

Why did it take so long?
Why did it take so long?
Why did it take us so long to just let go?
Why did it take us so long to start holding on?

Stop asking why
Why we had to waste so much time
Well, we just pick up, pick up and start again
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
If you wanna call me up or come over
Come on, we'll laugh 'till we cry
Like we did when we were kids
'Cause we can't keep holding on to grudges
We can't keep holding on to grudges

Could it be that I've changed?
Could it be that I've changed?
Could it be that I've changed?
Could it be that I've changed or did you?
