I can't call you a stranger
But I can't call you
I know you think that I erased you
You may hate me but I can't hate you
And I won't replace you

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

Think I'm tired of getting over it
And just starting something new again
I'm getting sick of the beginnings
And always coming to your defenses
I guess it's good to get it off my chest
Guess I can't believe I haven't yet
You know I got my own convictions
And they're stronger than any addiction
And no one's winning

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

Keep me up with your silence
Take me down with your quiet
Of all the weapons you fight with
Your silence is the most violent

Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?
Tell me how to feel about you now
Tell me how to feel about you now
Oh, let me know
Do I suffocate or let go?

You don't have to tell me
If you ever think of me
I know you see me dancing
Wildly in the fog of your memory
You don't have to tell me
I can still believe
