Standing here like I'm supposed to say something
Don't hold your breath, I never said I'd save you, honey
And I don't want your money
If I was you I'd run from me or rip me open
You'll see you're not the only one who's hopeless
Be sure to put your faith in something more
I'm just a girl and you're not as alone as you feel
We all got problems, don't we
We all need heroes, don't we
But rest assured there's not a single person here who's worthy
La, la la la la la la

Don't let me let you down
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
Or get your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
That I'm gonna be the one that let you down

Oh, it's such a long and awful lonely fall
Down from this pedestal that you keep putting me on
What if I fall on my face?
What if I make a mistake?
If it's OK a little grace would be appreciated
Remember how we used to like ourselves
What little light there's left, we need to keep it sacred
I know that you're afraid to let all the dark escape you
But we can let the light illuminate these hopeless places
La, la la la la la la

Just let me let you down
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
Or get your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
That I'm gonna be the one that let you down

La la la la la la
La la la la la la

Oh no, I ain't your hero
You're wasting all your faith on me
Oh no, I know where this goes
Think it's safe to say your saviour doesn't look a thing like me
La, la la la la la la

Don't let me let you down
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
Or get your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
Hey baby, I'm not your superhuman
And if that's what you want
I hate to let you down
Or get your hopes up
Now I got you hoping
That I'm gonna be the one that let you down
