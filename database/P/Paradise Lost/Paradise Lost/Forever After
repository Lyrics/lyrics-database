It’s orchestrated by another hand
Believe inferior dreams that I am
Orchestrated, I don’t understand
Belief increasing in me that I am

If only
We could see and live the dream
If only
We could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after
Maybe (sing)
Forever after

Without frustration
With no master plan
With nothing left
Of the dream that began

If only
We could see and live the dream
If only
We could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after
Maybe (sing)
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after
Maybe (sing)
Forever after

If only
We could see and live the dream
If only
We could still believe the dream

Frailty
Frailty
Say you love me
’Til I get back

Forever after
Forever after
Maybe (sing)
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after
Maybe (sing)
Forever after

If only
We could see and live the dream
If only
We could still believe the dream
