It’s orchestrated by another hand
Believe inferior dreams, that I am
Orchestrated, I don’t understand
Belief increasing in me, that I am

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever after

Without frustration
With no master plan
With nothing left of the dream that began

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever after

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream

Frailty, frailty
Say you love me, ’til I get back

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever after

Forever after
Forever after maybe (sing)
Forever after

If only we could see and live the dream
If only we could still believe the dream
