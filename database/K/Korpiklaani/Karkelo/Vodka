Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Vodka! Hey!

Vodka, you’re feeling stronger
Vodka, no more feeling bad
Vodka, your eyes are shining
Vodka, you are the real man

Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears
Vodka, everyone is gorgeous
Vodka, yeah vodka

Drinking is good for you,
soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you,
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you,
and you will feel awesome
and you will feel awesome

Hey!

Out of respect for nature,
Our vodka and drinkers.
Promising, that the vodka
we reserve, is as pure as it was
thousands of years ago

Out of respect for nature,
Our vodka and drinkers.

Vodka, you’re feeling stronger
Vodka, no more feeling bad
Vodka, your eyes are shining
Vodka, you are the real man

Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears
Vodka, everyone is gorgeous
Vodka, yeah vodka

Drinking is good for you,
soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you,
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you,
and you will feel awesome

Drinking is good for you,
soon you are unconstrained
Drinking is good for you,
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you,
Yeah!

Yeah!

Vodka, you’re feeling stronger
Vodka, no more feeling bad
Vodka, your eyes are shining
Vodka, you are the real man

Vodka, wipes away your tears
Vodka, removes your fears

Drinking is good for you,
Here comes the womanizer
Drinking is good for you
Not anymore lonesome
Drinking is good for you,
