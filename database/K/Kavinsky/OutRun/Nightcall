I’m giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I’m gonna tell you something you don’t want to hear
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I’m gonna show you where it’s dark, but have no fear
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)

There’s something inside you
It’s hard to explain
They’re talking about you, boy
But you’re still the same

There’s something inside you
It’s hard to explain
They’re talking about you, boy
But you’re still the same

I’m giving you a night call to tell you how I feel
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I want to drive you through the night, down the hills
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I’m gonna tell you something you don’t want to hear
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)
I’m gonna show you where it’s dark, but have no fear
(We’ll go all, all, all night long)

There’s something inside you
It’s hard to explain
They’re talking about you, boy
But you’re still the same

There’s something inside you
It’s hard to explain
They’re talking about you, boy
But you’re still the same
