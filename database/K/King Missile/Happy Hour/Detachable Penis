I woke up this morning
With a bad hangover
And my penis was missing again
This happens all the time, it’s detachable

(Detachable penis)

This comes in handy a lot of the time
I can leave it home
get me in trouble
Or I can rent it out when I don’t need it

But now and then I go to a party,
Get drunk, and the next morning
I can’t, for the life of me,
Remember what I did with it

First I looked around my apartment
And I couldn’t find it
So I called up where the party was
They hadn’t seen it either
I asked them to check the medicine cabinet
’Cause, for some reason I leave it there sometimes
But, not this time
So I told them if it pops up to let me know

I called a few people who were at the party
But they were of no help either
I was starting to get desperate
I really don’t like being without my penis for too long
Make me feel like less of a man
And, I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak

After a few hours searching the house,
Calling everyone I could think of,
I was starting to get very depressed, so
I went to the kia and ate breakfast

Then as I walked down the 2nd Avenue
Towards St. Marks place
Where all those people sell XXX
And other junk on the street

I saw my penis lying on a blanket
Next to a broken toaster oven
Some guy was selling it
I had to buy it off him
He wanted 22 bucks
But I talked him down to 17
I took it home, washed it off
And put it back on
I was happy again, complete

People sometimes tell me
I should get it permanently attached,
But, I dunno…
Even if sometimes it’s a pain in the ass
I like having a detachable penis

(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
(Detachable penis)
