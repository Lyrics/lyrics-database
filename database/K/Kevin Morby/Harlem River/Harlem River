One, two, three, four

Harlem River, talk to me
Tell me what you think about
Harlem river, I’m in love, love, love, love

Harlem River, talk to me
Where we headed now?
Harlem River, I’m in love, love, love, love
All because of you

In my pearl and my diamond shoes,
I’ve climbed a cloud, now I’ve stole the moon
Harlem River, all because of you

And Harlem River, swallow me
Put your hands around my neck
And Harlem River, I can’t breathe
They’ve got the lights down now

And Harlem River, give me wings
Put my head up in the clouds
And Harlem River, all because
Oh, I’m nowhere now

Harlem River, tell me is it true?
That in my pearl and diamond shoes,
I’ve climbed a cloud, now I stole the moon
Harlem River, all because of you

And I don’t know
I don’t know
Just where I’m going
’Cause I’ve never been

And I don’t know
I don’t know
Just where I’m going
Or where I’ve been

Oh, Harlem River
Like a diamond

And ride on that easy rider
Flow like that Harlem River

And ride on that easy rider
Flow like that Harlem River

I ride for you
i ride for you
I ride for you
i ride for you
