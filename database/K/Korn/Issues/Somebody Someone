I can’t stand to let you win
I’m just watching you
And I don’t know what to do
Feeling like a fool inside
Feeling all the love you hide
Thought you were my friend
Seems it never ends

I need somebody, someone
Can’t somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved, just for me

Giving you with this and that
Giving, getting nothing back
It’s all related to
All the things I do
Feeling like a fool inside
Seeing all the things you tried
I am nothing

I need somebody, someone
Can’t somebody help me?
All I need is to be
Loved, just for me

I look
I sign
I need
Someone
Inside
To help
Me out
With what?
I’m trying
I’m crying
I’m prying
In a pile of
Shit
I’m dying
I’m dying
I’m dying!

I need somebody (Somebody!)
Somebody (Somebody!)
Someone

I need somebody (Somebody!)
Somebody (Somebody!)
Someone

Someone
