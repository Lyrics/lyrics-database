Something takes a part of me
Something lost and never seen
Every time I start to believe
Something’s raped and taken from me, from me

Life’s got to always be messing with me
Can’t they chill and let me be free?
Can’t I take away all this pain?
I try to every night, all in vain, in vain

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it’s my life I can’t taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You’ll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Feeling like a freak on a leash
Feeling like I have no release
How many times have I felt diseased?
Nothing in my life is free, is free

Sometimes I cannot take this place
Sometimes it’s my life I can’t taste
Sometimes I cannot feel my face
You’ll never see me fall from grace

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Take it over here, baby
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema

Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema
Da boom na da mmm dum na ema

So, fight something on the
Fight, somethings they fight
So, something on the
Fight, somethings they fight

Fight, something of the
No, somethings they fight
Fight, something of the
Fight, somethings they fight

Something takes a part of me
You and I were meant to be
A cheap fuck for me to lay
Something takes a part of me

Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
Part of me
