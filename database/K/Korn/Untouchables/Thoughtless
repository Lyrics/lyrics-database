Thumbing through the pages
Of my fantasies
Pushing all the mercy
Down, down, down

I wanna see you try
To take a swing at me
Come on, gonna put you on the
Ground, ground, ground

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it’s funny, what the fuck you think it’s doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

All
Of my hate cannot be bound (hate cannot be bound)
I will not be drowned (I will not be drowned)
By your thoughtless scheming

So
You can try to tear me down (try to tear me down)
Beat me to the ground (beat me to the ground)
I will see you screaming

Thumbing through the pages of my fantasies
I’m above you, smiling at you
Drown, drown, drown
I wanna kill and rape you

The way you raped me
And I’ll pull the trigger
And you’re
Down, down, down

Why are you trying to make fun of me?
You think it’s funny, what the fuck you think it’s doing to me?
You take your turn lashing out at me
I want you crying with your dirty ass in front of me

All
Of my hate cannot be bound (hate cannot be bound)
I will not be drowned (I will not be drowned)
By your thoughtless scheming

So
You can try to tear me down (try to tear me down)
Beat me to the ground (beat me to the ground)
I will see you screaming

(All my friends are gone, they died)
Gonna take you down!
(They all screamed and cried)
Gonna take you down

(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
Gonna take you down!
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
Gonna take you down!

(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
Gonna take you down!
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)
(I’ve got my body, got my body back against the wall)

All
Of my hate cannot be bound (hate cannot be bound)
I will not be drowned (I will not be drowned)
By your thoughtless scheming

So
You can try to tear me down (try to tear me down)
Beat me to the ground (beat me to the ground)
I will see you screaming

All
Of my hate cannot be bound (hate cannot be bound)
I will not be drowned (I will not be drowned)
By your thoughtless scheming

So
You can try to tear me down (try to tear me down)
Beat me to the ground (beat me to the ground)
I will see you screaming
