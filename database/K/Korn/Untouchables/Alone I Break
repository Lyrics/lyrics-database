Pick me up
I’ve been bleeding too long
Right here, right now
I’ll stop it somehow

I will make it go away
Can’t be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone

These feelings will be gone
These feelings will be gone

Now I see the times, they change
Leaving doesn’t seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind

All this shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Shut me off
I’m ready, heart stops
I stand alone
Can’t be on my own

I will make it go away
Can’t be here no more
Seems this is the only way
I will soon be gone

These feelings will be gone
These feelings will be gone

Now I see the times, they change
Leaving doesn’t seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind

All this shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Am I going to leave this place?
What is it I’m running from?
Is there nothing more to come?
(Am I gonna leave this place?)

Is it always black in space?
Am I going to take its place?
Am I going to leave this race?
(Am I going to leave this race?)

I guess God’s up in this place?
What is it that I’ve become?
Is there something more to come?
More to come

Now I see the times, they change
Leaving doesn’t seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind

All this shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?

Now I see the times, they change
Leaving doesn’t seem so strange
I am hoping I can find
Where to leave my hurt behind

All this shit I seem to take
All alone I seem to break
I have lived the best I can
Does this make me not a man?
