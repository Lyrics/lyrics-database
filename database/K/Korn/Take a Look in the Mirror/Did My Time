Realized I can never win
Sometimes feel like I have failed
Inside where do I begin?
My mind is laughing at me

Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren’t we supposed to be the same?
That’s why I will never tame
This thing that’s burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn’t last
I feel the life pulled from me
I feel the anger changing me

Sometimes I can never tell
If I’ve got something after me
That’s why I just beg and plead
For this curse to leave me

Tell me, why am I to blame?
Aren’t we supposed to be the same?
That’s why I will never tame
This thing that’s burning in me

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn’t last
I feel the life pulled from me (that’s burning in me)
I feel the anger changing me

Betrayed
I feel so
Enslaved
I really tried

I did my time
I did my time

I did my time
I did my time

I did my time

I am the one who chose my path
I am the one who couldn’t last
I feel the life pulled from me (that’s burning in me)
I feel the anger changing me

Oh God, the anger’s changing me
Oh God, the anger’s changing me
