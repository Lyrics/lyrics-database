I’ll never love again (Love again, love again)
I won’t ever have to pretend (Pretend, pretend, pretend, pretend)
I’m never gonna love again (Love again, love again)

Damn

I don’t ever want to have to try and though I lie, it never flies
I don’t ever wanna have to die, but deep inside, the death it hides
And I never wanna clarify and justify, so I run and hide
And I never wanna signify, so I pacify all the hate inside

(No) I’ll never love again
(No) I won’t ever have to pretend
(No) I’m never gonna love again
Never gonna have to try to pretend
Never, never, never

I don’t ever wanna satisfy, ’cause things inside are doin’ fine
I don’t ever wanna multiply, ’cause deep inside I’m not qualified
And I never wanna clarify and justify, so I run and hide
And I never wanna signify, so I pacify all the hate inside

(No) I’ll never love again
(No) I won’t ever have to pretend
(No) I’m never gonna love again
Never gonna have to try to pretend
Never, never, never

I’ll never love again
I’m never gonna love again

Never, never, never

(No) I’ll never love again
(No) I won’t ever have to pretend
(No) I’m never gonna love again
Never gonna have to try to pretend
Never, never, never

(No) Never, never, never
(No) Never, never, never
(No) I’m never gonna love again
Never gonna have to try to pretend
Never, never, never
