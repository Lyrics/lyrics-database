Help me, I am freaking, and my heart is barely beating
And the demons, they are creeping around
Take me, I am sinking, and my lungs are barely breathing as the angels put me into the ground

And everybody’s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

Slap me, I am shaking, and my guts are really aching
And the demons, they’re laughing out loud
Spare me, I am fading, and my will is dissipating as the angels put me into the ground.

And everybody’s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

My mind is debating, these lesions I’m making
This mess is sedating, the power embracing
The bullshit I’m facing, my feelings, I’m hating
Reality is failing, this shit is degrading

And everybody’s peeking, no one makes a sound
The shadows are deceiving, paranoid and aroused

The bullshit I’m facing, my feelings, I’m hating
Reality, it’s failing
This shit is degrading
