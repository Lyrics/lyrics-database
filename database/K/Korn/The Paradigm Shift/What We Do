Sometimes things get in the way, my thoughts I cannot convey
It’s all pointing straight at you
We hate loving everyday
Our lives, twirled in every way, I give it all back to you

I can’t help this going down

I can’t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That’s what we do, we do

Sometimes, things don’t go away
In turn, you just run away
It’s all coming back for you, betrayed, life is in decay
Your thoughts you cannot obey
Right now, whatcha gonna do?

I can’t help this going down

I can’t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That’s what we do, we do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do
We do, we do, we do

I hear the calling of the helpless stranger
He’s all alone and no one gets his anger
I feel this pain everytime I’m here with you, with you
All the heartache and the fucked up insults
I find you begging on your knees, I figured
This is how it’s supposed to be with you, with you

I can’t wait for your lies to be broken down
I gave you Hell

I can’t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That’s what we do
I can’t take this, all my life is reckless
All our lies are dangerous, but we fake our way through
That’s what we do
