We are the ones taking all the pain, falling on our faces
They don’t care anyway, anyway, now
You’re the one that makes me feel like I’m alive
You’re the one that pushes me all the time, all the time, now

We are hard and grey, always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged, feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away, seeking out the path, but the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous, don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins

We are the ones reaching out in vain, trying to solve our problems
They won’t go away, go away now
You’re the one that makes me feel like I’m alive
You’re the one that pushes me all the time, all the time, now

We are hard and grey, always praised to do what they say
Calling me deranged, feeling power, I must take its place some way

Never gonna run away, seeking out my path, but the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous, don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins

Never gonna run away, seeking out my path, but the pain always gets in the way
Slowly watch me die
I’m insane, so dangerous, don’t you dare get in my way
Throwing in the towel, got me strained, so betrayed, get the fuck out of my way
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time pounding all these spikes in my veins

Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins, pounding all these spikes in my veins
Pounding all these spikes in my veins
Looking at my thoughts, I take my time, pounding all these spikes in my veins
