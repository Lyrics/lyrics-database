Wake up, it’s almost over
Something is taking me
Every time I’m up, it kills me
With a day to day, shock-waves shatter me

I don’t beg in security
Get up and don’t look back now, don’t look back now

We ride a dying star across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria

Giving up, I won’t stop fighting
Bring it on, it won’t phase me
Any time it makes me stronger
With a day to day, shock-waves shatter me

I don’t beg in security
Get up and don’t look back now, don’t look back now

We ride a dying star across a burning sea
We’re like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria

Going on day to day, stirring up the heavy sorrow
Why does life got be this way?
Every time I’m up, it kills me
Somewhere deep, responding change
Manipulation rampant all around
Dark all these days, calling on something to follow

Mass hysteria
(Mass hysteria)

We ride a dying star across a burning sea.
We’re like a supernova now, the fire is burning in me
Mass hysteria, mass hysteria
