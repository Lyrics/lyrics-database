Hands reaching slowly for one another
From the far ends of the wall
Shadow fingers walk the weakened
Music was made for the night

Red tape lies in the dark
Abandoned souls sleeping in the park
They would die for a piece of your heart
... when to start

...
We can see it
When he comes
We'll be ready for the truth
We will be crossing the holy desert
I will be sailing through the sand
Something ...
A little further
A little further is the promised land

(Only you keep me going)
(Through my daydreams, through my ..., through myâ€¦)
(Only you keep me going)
(Through my barriers, through my setbacks, through my memories)
(Like only ...)
(Like only ...)
