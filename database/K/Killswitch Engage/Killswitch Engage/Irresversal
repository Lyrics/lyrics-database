Look behind what lies on the surface

Rituals to read the signs
Signify the life I leave behind
Behind, lies

I am (I am) not over
This is (this is) greater than I
I am (I am) not over
This is (this is) greater than I

Set me free
Release me
Embrace me
Cleanse me

Rituals to read the signs
Signify the life I leave behind
Behind, lies

I am (I am) not over
This is (this is) greater than I
I am (I am) not over
This is (this is) greater than I

Set me free
Release me
Embrace me
Cleanse me

Look behind what lies on the surface
Humbled soul to reveal purpose

Outstretched arms
To welcome the sacrifice of this body

Outstretched arms
To welcome the sacrifice
Of this body

Look behind what lies on the surface
Humbled soul to reveal a purpose
