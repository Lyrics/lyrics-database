I have opened my eyes to see
The world that surrounds me, daily
I refuse to be led by the majority
Can’t compromise, I and I

To pass judgment
Judgment will
Be passed upon you

I have opened my eyes to see
The world that surrounds me, daily
I refuse to be led by the majority
Can’t compromise, I and I

To pass judgment
Judgment will
Be passed upon you

I will stand up for who I am
(Never moved)
Never moved by condemnation

No one is placed higher than another
No matter race or creed or gender
We must teach forgiveness and compassion
For all life

Through understanding (understand)
Of our differences
We will find respect for one another
Because we are all flesh and blood

No one is placed higher than another
No matter race or creed or gender
We must teach forgiveness and compassion
For all life

I am not afraid
To speak my mind
No matter the consequences
(Stay true to myself)

Through the humble eyes of a child
We will realize true equality

They cannot take me from me
They cannot take you from you
They cannot take I from I
They cannot take I from I
They cannot take me from me
They cannot take you from you
They cannot take I from I
