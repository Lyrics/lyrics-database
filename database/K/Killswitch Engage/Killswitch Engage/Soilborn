Time will not stand still
Today is the day the day of salvation
Living for more than just a synthetic force fed existence
This is my disposition I will strive for the thruth
This is my disposition I will strive for integrity
Time will not stand still
We are the soilborn we are the children soilborn
Washed in blood because we are blind
We must not take this life for granted
In this everlasting thirst to mantain vitality
This is my disposition I will strive to find rebirth
Today is the day of salvation
Life has only just begun today is the day
