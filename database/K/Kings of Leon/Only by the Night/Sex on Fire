Lay where you’re laying
Don’t make a sound
I know they’re watching
They’re watching

All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
Has people talking
They’re talking

You
Your sex is on fire

The dark of the alley
The breaking of day
Head while I’m driving
I’m driving

Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you’re dying
You’re dying

You
Your sex is on fire

Consumed
With what’s just transpired

Hot as a fever
Rattling bones
I could just taste it
Chased it

But it’s not forever
But it’s just tonight
Oh, we’re still the greatest
The greatest
The greatest

And you
Your sex is on fire

You
Your sex is on fire

Ah

Consumed
With what’s just transpired

And you
Your sex is on fire

Consumed
With what’s just transpired
