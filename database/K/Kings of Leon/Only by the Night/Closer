Stranded in the spooky town
Stoplights are swaying and the phone lines are down
The floor is crackling cold
She took my heart, I think she took my soul
With the moon I run
Far from the carnage of the fiery sun

Driven by the strangle of vein
Showing no mercy, I’d do it again
Open up your eye
You keep on crying, baby, I’ll bleed you dry
The skies, they blink at me
I see a storm bubbling up from the sea

Now it’s coming closer
Now it’s coming closer

You shimmy shook my bone
Leaving me stranded, all in love on my own
Do you think of me?
Where am I now, baby, where do I sleep?
Feels so good, but I’m old
Two thousand years of chasing, taking its toll

Now it’s coming closer
Now it’s coming closer
Now it’s coming closer
Now it’s coming closer
