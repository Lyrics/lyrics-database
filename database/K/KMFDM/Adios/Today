Isolation
When you leave it’s like I disappear
Desolation
Every time you go it feels like
Seconds slowly turn to minutes
A month of Sundays coming up
Time again it pulls me under
Wonder if I’ll ever rise above
It’s too much but not enough

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It’s here today but it’s gone tomorrow
It’s here today and today will never come again
It’s here today

Desperation
Sinking into somewhere dark and cold
Deviation
A place I knew I didn’t wanna go
To forget is all I know

Misery loves company
For a little bit of sympathy

It’s here today but it’s gone tomorrow
It’s here today and today will never come again
It’s here today but it’s gone tomorrow
It’s here today and today will never come again
It’s here today

Minutes slowly turn to hours
Another moment passes by
Seconds of eternity
I wonder if it’s time to say goodbye

It’s here today but it’s gone tomorrow
It’s here today and today will never come again
It’s here today but it’s gone tomorrow
It’s here today and today will never come again
It’s here today
