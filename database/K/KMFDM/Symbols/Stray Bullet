I am your holy totem
I am your sick taboo
Radical and radiant
I’m your nightmare coming true

I am your worst enemy
I am your dearest friend
Malignantly malevolent
I am of divine descent

I am your apocalypse
I am your belief unwrought
Monolithic juggernaut
I’m the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
From the barrel of love
Stray bullet
From the heavens above
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I’m the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I’m the illegitimate son of God

I have come to rock your world
I have come to shake your faith
Anathematic anarchist
I have come to take my place

I am your apocalypse
I am your belief unwrought
Monolithic juggernaut
I’m the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
From the barrel of love
Stray bullet
From the heavens above
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I’m the illegitimate son of God

Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I’m the illegitimate son of God

(Even if God really existed)
(It would be necessary to abolish him!)

I am your unconsciousness
I am unrestrained excess
Metamorphic restlessness
I’m your unexpectedness

Stray bullet
(From the barrel of love)
Stray bullet
(From the heavens above)
Stray bullet
(Ready or not)
(I’m the illegitimate son of God)

Stray bullet
(From the barrel of love)
Stray bullet
(From the heavens above)
Stray bullet
(Ready or not)
(I’m the illegitimate son of God)

Stray bullet
From the barrel of love
Stray bullet
From the heavens above
Stray bullet
Ready or not
I’m the illegitimate (son of God)

Stray bullet
(From the barrel of love)
Stray bullet
(From the heavens above)
Stray bullet
(Ready or not)
(I’m the illegitimate son of God)

Stray bullet
(From the barrel of love)
Stray bullet
(From the heavens above)
Stray bullet
(Ready or not)
(I’m the illegitimate son of God)
