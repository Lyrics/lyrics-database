(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah)
(What condition my condition was in)

I woke up this mornin’ with the sundown shinin’ in
I found my mind in a brown paper bag, within
I tripped on a cloud and fell eight miles high
I tore my mind on a jagged sky

I just dropped in
To see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah)
(What condition my condition was in)

I pushed my soul in a deep dark hole, and then I followed it in
I watched myself crawlin’ out as I was crawlin’ in
I got up so tight, I couldn’t unwind
I saw so much, I broke my mind

I just dropped in
To see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah)
(What condition my condition was in)

Someone painted “April Fool” in big black letters on a dead end sign
I had my foot on the gas as I left the road and blew out my mind
Eight miles out of Memphis and I got no spare
Eight miles straight up downtown somewhere

I just dropped in
To see what condition my condition was in

I said, I just dropped in
To see what condition my condition was in

(Yeah, yeah, oh yeah)
