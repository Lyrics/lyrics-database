I’ve been waitin’ for so long
Gettin’ had and treated wrong
Sleepless nights and dirty lies
Makes no difference if you live or die

But it’s over now
’Cause babe, I’m a winning man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ah!

I live my life the way I choose, yea (that’s right)
Satisfied, not much to lose
If you don’t feel, you’ll never know
Just what I’ve been goin’ through for so long

But it’s over now
’Cause babe, I’m a winning man
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

But it’s over now, yeah-yeah-yeah
’Cause babe, I’m a winning man
Oh-oh, I’m a winner, baby

Listen, listen, listen, listen!

But it’s over, it’s over now, yeah
It’s over, over now
It’s over, baby, right now
Right now, right now, right now

It’s over
It’s over
It’s over now
Baby, it’s over
Baby, it’s over
It’s over right now

Baby, gimme more
Some more
Gimme me some more of that sweet-sweet loving, baby
You ...

Yea!
