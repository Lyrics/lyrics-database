The world gets smaller
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller
You might be bigger, but I’m much smarter
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller

What don’t kill you lets you live
To remember what it did
I’m a bit relieved you’re still the same
’Cause there’s no illusion you’ve changed

Now it’s all over
I see now, I’m a veteran of things I don’t want to be

And the more I learn, the less I know
And the deeper it feels, the less it shows
There was a time and a day when
I didn’t think I would be here

But now, it’s all over
I see now, I’m a veteran of things I don’t want to be
I’ve been down, and it’s over
’Cause I see now, I’m a veteran of things I don’t want to be

The world gets smaller
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller
You might be bigger, but I’m much smarter
My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller
(My heart beats bigger, the world gets smaller)

Now that it’s over
I see now, I’m a veteran of things I don’t want to be
Get down, and it’s over
’Cause I see now, I’m a veteran of things I don’t want to be
I don’t want to be
