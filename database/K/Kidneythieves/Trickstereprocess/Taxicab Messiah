My god loved the whores and babies
My god never noticed a sin
My god grew and killed the daisies
My god threw the towel in

My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
Of fear
He’s driving in gear

One day got sick of hailing Mary’s
Hailed you, got the door and slid on in
Told me you were good at fortune telling
Said too much, threw the towel in

My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
Of fear
He’s driving in gear

Paid for my ride
Paid for my ride
Paid for my ride
Paid for my ride

My god paints a pretty picture
My god paints a pretty picture
My god paints a pretty picture
My god paints a pretty picture

Told him we could take the long way
Held on to everything he said
Wanted insight or an answer
Pointed the rear-view at my head

My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture
My god is weird, my god is scared, my god paints a pretty picture

All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
All in all, what does it mean?
