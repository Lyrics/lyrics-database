Where’s your…
Where’s your…
Where’s your good fire, baby?

Glitter girl, woman
waste your years
Glitter girl, woman
I know where you live
Hey woman, off my dreams
Glitter girl, woman
they’re not what you think

Where’s your…
Where’s your…
where’s your good fire, baby?

Glitter girl, woman
fox in your hole
Glitter girl, woman
I know that you sold me
Hey woman, let it go
Glitter Girl, woman
don’t pray for me anymore

Where’s your…
Where’s your…
where’s your good fire, baby?

There are skies that don’t have clouds like you
There are skies that don’t rain down like you
There are skies with a silver cloud
There are skies that you’re not around
There are skies that paint a bluer blue

Glitter girl, woman
waste your years
Glitter girl, woman
you’re better than this
hey woman, who are you for?
Glitter girl, woman
I’ll pray for you some more

Where’s your…
Where’s your…
where’s your good fire, baby?

There are skies that don’t have clouds like you
There are skies that don’t rain down like you
There are skies with a silver cloud
There are skies that you’re not around
There are skies that paint a bluer blue

There are skies with a silver cloud
There are skies that you’re not around
There are skies that paint a bluer blue

There are skies that don’t have clouds like you
There are skies that don’t rain down like you

Skies…
Skies…

There are skies that don’t have clouds like you
There are skies that don’t rain down like you

Where’s your…
Where’s your…
Where’s your good fire, baby?
