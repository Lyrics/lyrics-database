Got hair as black as night
Got a skirt that’s a-ooh so tight
I’m tellin’ you I’ve got an itch
She’s my witch

Loveable, she’s good and bad
Mess around and you been had
Got a key and the master switch
She’s my witch

Likes to rock to a crazy song
Every night she’s a-wailin’ on
She’s a chick with a wicked twitch
She’s my witch

Likes to drag in a goin’ mill
Plays a-chicken just for the thrill
Till you wind up in a ditch
She’s my witch
