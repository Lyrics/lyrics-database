The wind is howling over the sea
The sea is restless, it beckons to me
I can’t go on, I can’t face the dark
My life is empty since my love has gone

Wish I could tell her, I love her so
Wish I could ask her which way to go
Should I find a new love or join my true love?
She whispers to me — Eternity

Oh how I cried as she whispered goodbye
She was so young, too young to die
As I walk into the stormy sea
The sea reachеs out to welcome me

Wish I could tеll her I love her so
Wish I could ask her which way to go
Tell me, my true love, what should I do, love?
What is out there waiting for me? — Eternity

The lightning flashed and the thunder crashed
And then I seem to hear her voice from the past
Remember darling, have faith in me
My love will last for all eternity

Wish I could join her, I love her so
What all at once I know the way I must go
I’ll live on for you love, you’ll always be my true love
Till some day we find our destiny — Eternity

Eternity

Eternity

Eternity
