Algal crawl
against the change.
Tardigrade waste.

Turn to face the choice you made,
watch these veins collapse and inflate
beneath the sun’s analgesic rays,
the flesh that melts and drains.

Turn to face the choice you made…

“Shouldn’t have
let you see him like this”,
“Shouldn’t have
let him see me like this”,
“Shouldn’t have
let me see you like this”.

Watch these veins collapse and inflate,
feel this phase divide and inflame.

Languid spores
of amoebic angst
force these fields to fade.

Turn to face the choice you made…
Turn to face the choice you made…

“Shouldn’t have
let you see him like this”,
“Shouldn’t have
let him see me like this”,
“Shouldn’t have
let me see you like this”.
“Shouldn’t have
let you see him like this”.

Algal crawl
against the change,
force these fields to fade.
