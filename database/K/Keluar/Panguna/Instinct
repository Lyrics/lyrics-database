I’ve been alone, I was born (it’s incurable).
‘Til the end we are…
animal.
Salival
benediction
tastes the same,
liable
to desperation.
(Suffer the whim to survive and to feel)
This chemical slope is surreal,
it’s the way we turn in circles
of delight and fear.
I’ve been alone…
I’ve been alone, I was born

heavily on our minds
to feel someone’s
flesh
and
bone
pressed against our own?
‘Til the end we are…
