Fall into the waves
like thistles in the waste.
Fall into the waves
like thistles in the waste.
And it saddens me to see you…

I knew her eyes and I could never give in.
Treading water on a river that runs
through the space we cleared,
we’ll rest her here.

It’s the horizon that is always ahead.

Fall into the waves
like thistles in the waste.
Fall into the waves
and it saddens me to see you…
but it’s what remains in nature’s way,
their jaws were strong and there’s nothing wrong.
There’s nothing wrong.
There’s nothing wrong.

I knew her eyes and I could never give in.
Treading water on a river that runs
through the space we cleared,
we’ll rest her here.

It’s the horizon that is always ahead.

Cleo was the first to go.

And it saddens me to see you…
but it’s what remains in nature’s way,
their jaws were strong and there’s nothing wrong.
There’s nothing wrong.

I knew her eyes and I could never give in.
Treading water on a river that runs
through the space we cleared,
we’ll rest her here.

It’s the horizon that is always ahead.
