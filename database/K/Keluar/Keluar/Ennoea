Withering under words you taught me
Withering under words you taught me
Comfort in the great machine
Withering under words you taught me

I’m not what you are
I’m not what you are

Wandering from the path you led me
The shadows are shattering
Wandering from the path you led me
The shadows are shattering

I’m not what you are
I’m not what you are

Ennoea
Ennoea

Withering under words you taught me
Comfort in the great machine

I’m not what you are
I’m not what you are

Ennoea
Ennoea
Ennoea
Ennoea
