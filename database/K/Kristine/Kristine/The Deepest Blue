Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Under the light and shades
Eons old and new
Watchin’ the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We’re endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Endless summer days
That I spent with you
Into the salty haze
Of our wildest youth
Watchin’ the sun go down in the deepest blue
Far in the distance sounds, only waves come through

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We’re endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
In the deepest blue
In the deepest blue

Swimming in the deepest
Swimming in the deepest
We’re in the deepest blue

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
We’re endless like the sea, a never-ending flow
An endless
An endless

So tell it on the streets, tell it on the radio
Tell it on the radio
We’re in the deepest blue
