Corner cut mindless
Morally is bankrupt
Here fitting nicely
Staying as it once was

A blissful sensation
The head tripping cave in
To feel the head shaken
Begin to collapse in the wiretrap feast of dreams

Where taken lightly
Clouded as light serene
Flame throwing tarot
All in a line descent

An instant recieving was better untreated
All problems lying low
Just under the skin’s glow
The Scarring convergence screams
With serious sides affecting
A serious inability to cease the faction
The long door closing in the face reacts
Toward a lonely lesson offering retraction
A memory hanging on now hung by the neck

It’s overly twisted
Rape and remind of waste
In devious flavors
Direct in defiling shame

When playing with fire
Burnt out desire
A kettle of blackness
Already fell into a pit of our own device

A serious disability
Devout the system
A sharp wedge dripping through the back up ahead
Toward one vicious world wide assumption
A force upon dictatorship
The future’s dead

A blissful sensation
The head tripping cave in
To feel the head shaken
Begin to collapse in the wiretap feast of dreams

An instant recieving
Was better untreated
All problems lying low
Just under the skin’s glow
The scarring convergence screams
With serious side affecting
