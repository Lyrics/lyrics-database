You think you’re evil but you’re not
Still sucking life from the mainstream
It’s so deluded, give it up
What’s that you hide behind your pile of shit?

Could it be that I have given up?
Feeling blind to all important scenes

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.

Find out exactly what is meant
To be abducted in between
Another moment documents
The fleeting magic of what could have been.

Could it be that I have given up?
Feeling blind to all important scenes

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.

I’m sitting on the back porch
so you can make my topic noting, it’s all relevant, what?
You want a seat on the back of my porch
to talk and wave a gun,
come touch my property, rape my bitch
rape my property as if you made a hitch,
wake up and I feel like shit
It’s all right,
it’s all right,
XXX

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.

Could it be that I have given up?
Feeling blind to all important scenes

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.

Eee-eeeee
It’s so deluded, give it up.
Eee-eeeee
It’s unoriginal.
