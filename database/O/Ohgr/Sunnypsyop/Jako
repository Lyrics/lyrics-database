(Only me)
Don’t know the light from darkness
(Only me)
Don’t have the right to get it or forget it
(Only me)
To clarify the conflict
(Only you)
Will never ever upset it or regret it

(I’m not anyone for you
Not anyone for me
Not anyone for you)

To clarify the conflict
Will never ever upset it
Will never ever regret it
Or upset it

Don’t know the light from darkness
Don’t have the right to get it
Don’t have the right to forget it
Or forget it

(I’m not anyone for you
Not anyone for me
Not anyone for you)

(Me)

(Me)

(Only me)

(Only me)

(Only me)

(Only me)

(Only me)

(Only me)
