It’s like loving a lion that cannot be tamed
I snap at the thought or the sound of your name
Pulling teeth from my stomach, you’ve been eaten alive
My blood fills your lungs, my soul you’re inside

My feet they stand on ashes
From the fires that you’ve made
Burning bridges
Just to save your face

If I say I wouldn’t be hostile (Hostile)
Could you say you would do the same? (Do the same?)
If we’re all made just a little bit broken (Broken)
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame

I’m sensing a feeling, picking wounds of regret
That left alone, there’s no scarring, I’ll dig and I’ll dig
Scratching and itching, I’ll keep biting my lip
From this pain that I’m feeling, picking wounds of regret

A cut cannot heal
Unless you leave it alone
I’ll open mine daily
Leaving bones exposed

Exposed

If I say I wouldn’t be hostile (Hostile)
Could you say you would do the same? (Do the same?)
If we’re all made just a little bit broken (Broken)
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame
To blame

Standing on ashes from the fires you’ve made
Burning your bridges just to save your face

Wounds of regret

If I say I wouldn’t be hostile
Could you say you would do the same?
If we’re all made just a little bit broken
Tell me who is to blame, tell me who is to blame
To blame

We’re broken, imperfect, we were all made the same
(We’re broken) We’re broken, imperfect, we are all to blame
