Did you ever contemplate when all was lost you hesitate and nothing seems the same?
Have you ever hid your face, in such disgrace, decisions made, a picture with no frame?

Can you hold on? One more day?

Say you’re okay, I’m afraid that tomorrow is just too far away.
Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me (down on me, me, me).

Rain will fall. Wash all the pain. It shields the soul, you turn the page to face another day.
Let me know that you will wait and I will pay for my mistakes to feel the sun again.

Can you hold on?

Say you’re okay, I’m afraid that tomorrow is just too far away.
Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me.

Don’t let go, time will heal.
Just don’t let go,
One day we can try to start again.

Say you’re okay, I’m afraid that tomorrow is just too far away.
Fight the pain, it just feels like forever, forever.
It feels like forever is crashing down on me (down on me, me, me).
