Here in this world I’m awaked with mistakes,
But it’s love that keeps fueling me, fueling me.

Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes,
Would you show them to me?
I know I’m not that perfect,
But you stay a while,
Baby, then you will see.

Miles away I can still feel you,
Lay your head down on my embrace, my embrace.
Far away.

Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes,
Would you show them to me?
I know I’m not that perfect,
But you stay a while,
Baby, then you will see.

Don’t give up baby,
I know that it’s shaky,
Just let love consume us, consume us.

Here in this world I’m awaked with mistakes,
But it’s love that keeps fueling me.
Fueling me, to love you.
Miles away I can still feel you
Lay your head down on my embrace.
Be not afraid, to love me.

Pretty little lady with your swollen eyes,
Would you show them to me?
I know I’m not that perfect,
But you stay a while,
Baby, then you will see.
