The sun don’t shine
The moon don’t move the tides
To wash me clean

Sun don’t shine
The moon don’t move the tides
To wash me clean

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs

Cold wind blows
The gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Cold wind blows
Gods look down in anger
On this poor child

Why so unforgiving and why so cold?
Been a long time crossing
The bridge of sighs
