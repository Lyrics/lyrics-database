I, once upon a time
Carried a burden inside
I sung a last goodbye
A broken rhyme I had underlined
There’s an ocean of sorrow in you

A sorrow in me

I saw a movement in their eyes
That said I no longer knew the way
I had given up the ghost
A passive mind submit to fear
And the wait for redemption at hand

Waiting to fail

Failing again

If death should take me now
Count my mistakes and let me through
Whisper in my ear
You have taken more than we’ve received
And the ocean of sorrow is you
