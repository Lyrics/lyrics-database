Let me taste
Let me feel
I need to know what you keep inside
No need to speak
Just let it be
Carry out this wish for me let nothing interfere

Rise to submission
I’m still beneath in the soil

Discard your clothes
Let loose you hair
We’re intertwined forever and have always been
Say the word
And I’ll depart
Upon your lips dwells nothing but the meaning of my cause

Rise to submission
I’m still beneath in the soil

And so comes the dark
Vibrant as ever before
Flowers already withered
In this endless winter of souls

Outside in the park
The days move along
And nothing ever changes
They have nothing on us
And we’ve always knew
That nothing ever changes

Rise to submission
I’m still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Depending on the life blood

Rise to submission
I’m still beneath in the soil
This is ours alone
Feeding off the warmth
Lured out from inside

Silently
Whispering
Move in me and set me free

"Htaed otni yaw eht dael
Won resolc
Peels rof gnol
Gnivael dna
Yawa gnidaf

Tuohtiw Od Nac I Tahw
Em Gniwohs
Thgil Laerehte
Raeppasid Dna
Edaf Sruoloc
Ecnart Gnihtoos"
