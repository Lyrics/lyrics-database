Losing sleep, In too deep
Fading sun, What have I done
Came so close to what I need most
Nothing left here
Cut the ties, Uncover disguise
Left behind all intertwined
Lost control, Moved out of the role now
Nothing’s left here
Leave it be
It was meant for me
Soul sacrifice
Forgot the advice
Lost track of time
In a flurry of smoke
Waiting anxiety
For a fair judgement deserved
