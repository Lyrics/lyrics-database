I am awaiting
The sunrise
Gazing modestly through the coldest morning
Once it came you lied
Embracing us over
Autumn’s proud treetops

I stand motionless
In a parade of falling rain
Your voice I cannot hear
As I am falling again

Devotion eludes
And in sadness I lumber
In my own ashes
I am standing without a soul
She wept and whispered:
"I know…"

We walked into the night
Am I
To bid you farewell?
Why can’t you see
that I try?
When every tear I shed
Is for you?
