Please remedy my confusion
And thrust me back to the day
The silence of your seclusion
Brings night into all you say

Pull me down again and guide me into pain

I’m counting nocturnal hours
Drowned visions in haunted sleep
Faint flickering of your powers
Leaks out to show what you keep

Pull me down again and guide me into…

There is failure inside
This test I can’t persist
Kept back by the enigma
No criterias demanded here
Deadly patterns made my wreath
Prosperous in your ways
Pale ghost in the corner
Pouring a caress on your shoulder

Ooh, puzzled by shrewd innocence
Runs a thick tide beneath
Ushered into inner graves
Nails bleeding from the struggle

It’s the end for the weak at heart
Always the same
A lullaby for the ones who’ve lost all
Reeling inside
Gleaming eye in your necklace reflects
Stare of primal regrets
You turn your back and you walk away
Never again

Spiraling to the ground below
Like autumn leaves left in the wake to fade
Waking up to your sound again
And lapse into the ways of misery
