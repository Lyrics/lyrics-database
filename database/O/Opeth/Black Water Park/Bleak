Beating
Heart still beating for the cause
Feeding
Soul still feeding on the loss
Aching
Limbs are aching from the rush
Fading
You are fading from my sight

Break of morning
Coldness lingers on
Shroud me into
Nightmares of the sun

Moving
I am moving closer to your side
Luring
You are luring me into the night
Crying
Who is crying for you here?
Dying
I am dying fast inside your tears

Plunging towards
Bereavement
Faster yet
Clearing thoughts
My mind
Is set

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You’re close to the final word
You’re staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Help me
Cure you
Atone for all you’ve done
Help me
Leave you
As all the days are gone

Devious movements in your eyes
Moved me from relief
Breath comes out white clouds with your lies
And filters through me

You’re close to the final word
You’re staring right past me in dismay
A liquid seeps from your chest
And drains me away

Mist ripples round your thin white neck
And draws me a line
Cold fingers mark this dying wreck
This moment is mine

Night falls again
Taking what’s left of me

Slight twist, shivering corpse
Ornated with water, fills the cracks
Clasped in my limbs by tradition
This is all you need
