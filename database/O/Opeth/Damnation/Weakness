Found you there
In the blink of an eye
I miss you
Turned away
Into a thousand dreams
Found out what they mean

Lost you there
In a moment of truth
I trust you
Gave away
The one and only heart
A gift to tear apart

Stain me
Save me
Take me to my home
Hold me
Show me
Take me to my home

Weaker now
Drawing fluid from me
You kill me
I’m not afraid
Of what you have just done
But of what you’ve just become
