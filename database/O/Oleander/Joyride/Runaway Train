It's a corner that you turn,
It's a lesson that you learn in time.
It's a worry that you feel,
Another scar that you conceal from sight.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?
Have I been away too long
For things to change?

From a runaway train.
Caught beneath the wheels
Of a runaway train.

Every moment of the day
I feel it crumbling away, if I…
I only have myself to blame
For all the cracks within the frame that I find.

Have I been away too long
For me to say?
Have I been away too long
For things to change?

From a runaway train.
Caught beneath the wheels
Of a runaway train.

Now I know how it feels
To be a runaway.
To be a runaway, hey yeah
To be a runaway, yeah

It's all right
It's okay
It's all right
