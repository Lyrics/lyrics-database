Open your shelters and let us all in
Tired and homeless are hungry again
Outside my window at fountain and vine
Drunks and the addicts are forming a line

Sharing their stories to comfort dispair
Carry the weight of the crosses they bear
Praying for courage and wisdom to change
Serenity costs more than pocket book change

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn’t belong to me, yeah

Sleeping on sidewalks is how people live
Begging for something no one wants to give
Size of your wealth is a bottle of wine
Sipped with your friends you’ll soon leave behind

Are your children in flames,
Incarcerated and bound by the chain?
Strangers paralyze
Down in the gutters of fountain and vine

I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls
I want to turn all the tables
And give back what doesn’t belong to me, yeah

Feel like running away, like running away
Tired of seeing them falling aside
There’s no running away
I’m running, I’m running away

I want to tear it all down
Build it all up from the ground
I want to tear down the walls
And shatter the image that falls on me

The view from down here
Brings mention to mind
Everything’s sacred on fountain and vine
