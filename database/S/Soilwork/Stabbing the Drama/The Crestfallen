Don’t question any lies there’s no reason to find

Another trip to cause a denial
Yet you’re stripped and your hope is gone
Another trap for you to fall into
You swallow every threat that will enter your mind

Enter your mind

A shadow just as dark as your past
Is leading the way through the web of desire
Healing all the wounds in your chest
Vengeance is rising

Can I ever resolve (can I ever resolve)
If it’s a matter of do or die?
Can I ever resolve
If it’s a matter of time?

(Just remember where you’ve spent your time)
Can’t respect all the tears you have cried
(Just remember how you’ve changed your life)
Can’t trace your fate with a pitiful crime

Pitiful crime

Don’t question any lies there’s no reason to find
Another trip to cause a denial
Yet you’re stripped and your hope is gone
Another trap for you to fall into

Can I ever resolve
If it’s a matter of do or die?
Can I ever resolve (can I ever resolve)
If it’s a matter of time?

(Just remember where you’ve spent your time)
Can’t respect all the tears you have cried
(Just remember how you’ve changed your life)
Can’t trace your fate with a pitiful crime

There’s no way you can dig much deeper
If you think it’s alright
Assorting the right from the wrong ones
That you have learned so well, so well

You’re stuck, you can’t remember
The light is turning dim
You’re trapped although you’ve been there
A thousand times before

You’re stuck, you can’t remember
The light is turning dim
You’re trapped although you’ve been there
A thousand times before

Crestfallen be thy name
Crestfallen be thy name
