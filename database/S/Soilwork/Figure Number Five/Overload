Still I’m spreading my disease
You’ll work it out this time
Hell no, I won’t retreat
Two times won’t make it happen
Three times won’t make it go
Overcome, make it run
I insist to make it flow

Now I’m chasing what I’ve learned
You won’t be blind this time
Getting back what they have burned
Two times won’t make it happen
Three times won’t mage it go
Overload, still it grows
I resist and make it flow

Trusting the ways of my vulnerable heart
A million times before I get things right
So fragile it hurts when I just fall apart
Right now

Still I won’t get what I deserve,
Your search for dreams may falter
Paying back won’t make it turn
Four times won’t make it happen
Five times won’t make it go
Overrule, from a tool
That brings me everlasting pain

Trusting the ways of my vulnerable heart
A million times before I get things right
So fragile it hurts when I just fall apart

(Those thoughts are ruling my valuable time)
Those thoughts are ruling my valuable time
(In search for shelter I draw the lines)
In search for shelter I draw the lines

Won’t you give me another break to examine
… my growing and countless mistakes

Trusting the ways of my vulnerable heart
A million times before I get things right
So fragile it hurts when I just fall apart

Trusting the ways of my vulnerable heart
A million times before I get things right
So fragile it hurts when I just fall apart
