Don’t kill yourself
Time will do it for you
Don’t kill yourself
Time will do it for you

Suicide is cringe
Suicide is cringe
Suicide is cringe
Suicide is cringe

Don’t kill yourself
You’ll die anyway, just wait
Don’t kill yourself
You’ll die anyway, just wait

Suicide is cringe
And nothing’s worse than cringe
Suicide is cringe
Cringe is worse than death

Don’t kill yourself
Death is gonna happen
Don’t kill yourself
Death will happen to you

Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)

Don’t kill yourself
Life will do it for you
Don’t kill yourself
Life will do it for you

Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)
Suicide is cringe (cringe!)

Don’t kill yourself
You’re too sexy
Don’t kill yourself
You’re too sexy
