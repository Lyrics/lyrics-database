Got a big plan, this mindset, maybe it’s right
At the right place and right time, maybe tonight
And the whisper or handshake, sending a sign
Wanna make out and kiss hard, wait, nevermind

Late night and passing, mention it flipped her
Best friend, that knows, saying maybe it slipped
But the slip turns to terror and a crush to light
When she walked in, he froze up, believe it’s the fright

It’s cute in a way, ’til you cannot speak
And you leave to have a cigarette, your knees get weak
An escape is just a nod and a casual wave
Obsessed about it, heavy for the next two days

It’s only just a crush, it’ll go away
It’s just like all the others, it’ll go away
Or maybe this is danger and he just don’t know
You pray it all away but it continues to grow

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, “I wanna fucking tear you apart”

Then he walked up and told her, thinking maybe it passed
And they talked and looked away a lot, doing the dance
Her hand brushed up against his, she left it there
Told him how she felt, and then they locked in a stare

They took a step back, thought about it, what should they do
’Cause there’s always repercussions when you’re dating in school
But their lips met, and reservations started to pass
Whether this was just an evening or a thing that would last

Either way he wanted her and this was bad
Wanted to do things to her, it was making him crazy
Now a little crush turned into a like
And now he wants to grab her by the hair and tell her

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, “I wanna fucking tear you apart”

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, “I wanna fucking tear you apart”

I want to hold you close, skin pressed against me tight
Lie still, close your eyes, girl, so lovely, it feels so right
I want to hold you close, soft breath, beating heart
As I whisper in your ear, “I wanna fucking tear you apart”
