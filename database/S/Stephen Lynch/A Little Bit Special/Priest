Deep in prayer, my cross to wear
I kneel upon the floor
Temptations of a Catholic priest
Aren’t easy to ignore
But I cannot control myself
He rips my soul apart
For one small sheep among my flock
Has stolen the shepherd’s heart

Altar boy, altar boy
Confess your sins to me
You will find the grace of God
Inside my rectory

At Sunday mass or bible class
I catch him in my view
I close my eyes but there he lies
Spread eagle on the pew
And when I see him in that frock
My conscience goes awry
I’ll give him some communion wine that's
Spiked with Spanish fly

Altar boy, altar boy
Is it gonna be heaven or hell?
You can play my organ all night long
If you promise never to tell

Our Father, who art in heaven
Hallowed be thy name
I could dress him up like the Pope and then I’d…
Oh dear God, the shame…
No-no-no, lead us not into temptation
Deliver us from sin
We could pretend that he was Jesus Christ
And I was Mary Magdalene

Altar boy, altar boy
Confess your sins to me
You will find the grace of God
Inside my rectory

Oh altar boy, oh altar boy
Confess your sins to me
You will find the grace of God
Inside my rectory
