Hush little girl, sweet baby don’t cry
Tonight
Daddy is here and he’ll sing you a soft lullaby
Tonight

Why can’t it all be like it was before?
How can I explain why mommy’s not here anymore?

’Cause daddy likes porno and ten dollar whores
Daddy gets wasted and robs liquor stores
Daddy likes rubbing against little boys on the bus
I think that’s why your mommy left us

Mommy left us

Hush little girl, there is no reason to fret
Tonight
Don’t mind the smoke, daddy just wants to forget
Tonight

Soon it will all be like it was before
Any minute she will walk through that front door

But daddy plays poker and drinks lots of beer
Then he wants sex that involves mommy’s rear
Daddy has sores on his naughty parts oozing with puss
I think that’s why your mommy left us

Please don’t cry
I swear I’ll try
To be here by
Your side

Right after daddy gets home from the bar
Visits his bookie, and steals a new car
He’ll drive to the strip club, and if daddy plays his cards right
He’ll bring home your new mommy tonight
