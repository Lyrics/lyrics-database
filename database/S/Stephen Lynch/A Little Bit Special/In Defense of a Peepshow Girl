I see you there behind the glass
I drop a quarter in the slot, and then I watch as you shake that ass
I watch you grind, I watch you dance
I show you mine, you show me yours, and when we’re done I button up my pants

And my friends all laugh, my friends all scoff
When I say I love a girl who loves to take it off
But I tell them that they’re crazy, ’cause I’ve been around the world
And there’s nothing wrong, oh nothing with my peepshow girl, no

No, there’s nothing wrong, no-no-no

I love your mind, I love your soul
I love it when you grease your body and you slide it up and down that pole — Yeah!
I love your hair, I love your eyes
And I know that you feel the same way ’cause I can see the love dripping down your thighs

And my mama would laugh, my mama would scoff
If she knew I loved a girl who loved to take it off
And she’d probably disown me if she met my little pearl
But there’s nothing wrong, oh mama with my peepshow girl, no

No, there’s nothing wrong, nothing wrong!

So now I’m broke, you bled me dry
And it’s amazing how much money that a guy will spend to taste a little pie
But I’m okay, I’m a little sore
I can’t believe that I found love in a place where my feet stick to the floor

And I went to confession and the preacher said, “no,
it’s a sin to love a girl who isn’t pure as driven snow”
I said, “preacher, I don’t care man, I found heaven in this world,
and there’s nothing wrong, oh preacher, with my peepshow girl, no”

I said, “there’s nothing wrong, nothing wrong with my peepshow girl”
