She’s part-girl, she’s part-boy
She’s got parts everyone can enjoy
She’s got more, she’s got less
She’s got her manhood tucked in her dress

Is she a mister or is she a miss?
Does she stand up when she’s taking a piss?
She’s my little girl, yeah, she’s my little guy
When I try to please her I get poked in the eye, ye

She wears lace and she wears flannel
She watched football and the Lifetime Channel
What’s that buldge under her nightie?
It must be hermaphrodite, yeah, hermaphrodite, a-ha

Some things are white, some things are black
Some girls wear makeup, mine shaves her back
But she is still beautiful, she is still fine
It’s too bad her package is bigger than mine, ye

She can’t help her imperfections
She gets jock itch from her yeast infections
Who stole all my tighty whities?
It must be hermaphrodite, yeah

Hermaphrodite, a-ha
Hermaphrodite
Ah-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la
Ooh, ooh, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh, aaa-aaa-aaa-aah, aaa-aaa-aaa-aah
Dite, yeah
