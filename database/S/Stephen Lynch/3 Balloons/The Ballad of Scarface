Do you know Tony Montana?
Rode a boat here from Havana
Scar from eating pussy lines his face

Finds a day job washing dishes
Hates his life, he only wishes
Some day in this world to find his place

And he has a scheme
For his own drug regime
Dream, Scarface, dream…

Hired by the gangster Omar
He climbs the ranks, he’s getting so far
Selling guns and drugs out in the streets

Soon he works for Frank, the main boss
Doing hits and dodging chainsaws
Getting rich and living life so sweet

But he craves romance
In his disco pants
Dance, Scarface, dance…

See, Tony wants to rule the world
So he kills Frank and steals his girl
She’ll give him the son he’s never had

Alas, her womb is so polluted
From the powder she has tooted
There’ll be no son, and that makes Tony sad

As he looks to the sky
Hear his plaintive cry
Fly, pelican, fly…

Now he starts to get too high
On his own supply
Thinking he’s the only game in town

And his enemies decide
On a plot of regicide
It’s time for the king to lose his crown
Scarface must go down…

Oh, Tony’s killers soon surround him
Sensing death has finally found him
He aims his gun, prepared to do his part

And as he shouts, “It’s not the end
Say hello to my little friend!”
Assassins’ bullets pierce his fragile heart

It’s a tragic goodbye
He had flown so high
Cuban butterfly
Die, Scarface, die…
