Under the parking lot
I was born inside of a man
Who suckles on a teat
Look at the momma’s time
It seems it couldn’t leave it alone
Who suckles on a teat…

Still I sleep like a…
Still I…
Still I sleep like a…
Still I…

Look at the laughter queen
It seems she left herself a quarter
To steal along the way
Here’s a laughter time
It seems it only costs a dollar
Four of us can play now

Still I sleep like a…
Still I…
Still I sleep like a…
Still I…

Still I sleepwalker
Stands in line
Still I steal the water
Steal the wine

Kill the lie
Kill the lie
Kill the lie
Where’d you go?

Still I…
Still only follow
But it failed, again

After the parking lot
It seems I was born inside of a man
Who suckles on a teat
Look at the momma’s time
It seems it couldn’t leave her alone
Who suckles on a teat…

Still I sleepwalker
Who stands in line
Still I sleepwalker
Who stands in line

Still I steal your water
Steal your wine
Still I sleepwalker
Sleepwalker…
