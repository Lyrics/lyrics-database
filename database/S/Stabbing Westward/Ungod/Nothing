Some nights I feel like I have died
Or something deep inside is dying
I try to understand my crimes
But there’s nothing here that really matters

I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you
I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you

I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, but I can’t stop myself

Now endless questions fill my head
Some nights I’m frightened by the answers
No you can’t hurt me, nothing’s real
No pain you cause can last forever

I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you
I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you

I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, but I can’t stop myself

One night I swore I’d die for you
There’s nothing else I’d rather die for
But I’ll try to live another night
There’s too much hate to be forgotten

I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you
I don’t want to believe in you
I can’t believe in you

I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it

I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, I don’t need it
I don’t want it, but I can’t stop myself
