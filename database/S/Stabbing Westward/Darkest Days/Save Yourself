I know your life is empty
And you hate to face this world alone
So you’re searching for an angel
Someone who can make you whole

I cannot save you
I can’t even save myself
So just save yourself

I know that you’ve been damaged
Your soul has suffered such abuse
But I am not your savior
I am just as fucked as you (I am just as fucked as you)

I cannot save you
I can’t even save myself
So just save yourself

Please don’t take pity on me
Please don’t take pity on me
Please don’t take pity on me
Please don’t take pity on me

My life has been a nightmare
My soul is fractured to the bone
If I must be lonely
I think I’d rather be alone (I think I’d rather be alone)

You cannot save me
You can’t even save yourself
I cannot save you

I can’t even save myself
Save yourself
So just save yourself
