I only see myself
Reflected in your eyes
So all that I believe I am
Essentially are lies
And everything I’d hoped to be
Or ever thought that I was
Died with your belief in me
So who the hell am I?

I don’t know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you
I don’t know what’s real without you
How can I exist without you?

I’m wandering around confused
Wondering why I tried
The more that you deny my pain
The more it intensifies
I pray for someone to ache for me
The way I ache for you
If you ignore that I’m alive
I’ve nothing to cling to

I don’t know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you
I don’t know what’s real without you
How can I exist without you?

I stare into this mirror
So tired of this life
If only you would speak to me
Or cared if I’m alive
Once I swore I would die for you
But I never meant like this
I never meant like this
No, I never meant like this

I don’t know if I am real without you
What is left of me without you
I don’t know what’s real without you
How can I exist without you?

How can I exist without you?

How can I exist without you?
