You make it hard to breathe
It’s as if I’m suffocating
And when you’re next to me
I can feel your heartbeat through my skin

It makes me sad to think this all could be for nothing
I wish there was a way
A way for you to see inside of me
I’ve never felt this way about anyone or anything

Tell me (what do I have to do) to make you happy?
(What do I have to do) to make you understand?
(What do I have to do) to make you want me?
And, if I can’t make you want me, what do I have to do?

I know exactly what you’re thinking
But I swear this time I will not let you down
I’m not as selfish as I used to be
That was a part of me that never made me proud

Right now I think I would try anything
Anything at all to keep you satisfied
God I hope you see what losing you would do to me
All I want is one more chance

Tell me (what do I have to do) to make you happy?
(What do I have to do) to make you understand?
(What do I have to do) to make you want me?
And, if I can’t make you want me, just tell me, tell me…

(What do I have to do) to make you want me?
(What do I have to do) to make you understand?
(What do I have to do) to make you love me?
And, if I can’t make you love me, just tell me, what do I have to do?

To forget about you…
