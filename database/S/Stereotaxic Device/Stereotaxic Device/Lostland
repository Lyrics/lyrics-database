Kaleidescopes are celebrating
Windows have wings
The suicide, the genocide
For the Indians, Indians

The signals, from heaven
Are like a sea of flames
The suicide, the genocide
For the Indians, Indian

Iâ€™ve forgotten, all traces
Of yesterday, yesterday
The suicide, the genocide
For the Indians, Indian

Kaleidescopes, are celebrating
Windows have wings
The suicide, the genocide
For the Indians, all the Indians
