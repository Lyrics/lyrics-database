Hunting the hunted
I never wanted
To play your game

In cold blood
The penetration
Turning blue blood red
I put a hole so deep, so deep within

So deep, so deep within

Hunting the hunted
I never wanted
To play your game
The bullet flies
In cold blood
The penetration
I put a hole so deep, so deep within

Hunting the hunted
I never wanted
To play your game
The bullet flies
In cold blood
The penetration
I put a hole so deep, so deep within

A canned hunt for the wealthy celebrity
A trophy for the sportsmen
A murder fix for your ego trip
Everything to have, and still not satisfied
Without the animals, what will substitute?
A murder fix for your ego trip

Hunting the hunted
I never wanted
To play your game
The bullet flies
In cold blood
The penetration
I put a hole so deep, so deep within
