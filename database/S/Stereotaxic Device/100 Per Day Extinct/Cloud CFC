The needless slaughter
Of Homo Sapien
The relentless assault
Earth shattering
Forever lasting
Survival

You’ve convicted the innocence
The needless slaughter
There must be a cure
Of malice
For this everlasting disease

I am enraged
Time to disengage
In a new revolution
Earth shattering

Everlasting disease

Do you fear?
Do you fear?

The needless slaughter

I am enraged
Time to disengage
In a new revolution

Do you fear?
Do you fear?

The needless slaughter

You’ve convicted the innocence
Time to disengage
In a new revolution

Do you fear?
Do you fear?

The needless slaughter

You’ve convicted the innocence
