When the Earth was still flat
And clouds made of fire
And mountains stretched up
To the sky, sometimes higher
Folks roamed the Earth like big rolling kegs
They had two sets of arms, they had two sets of legs
They had two faces peering out of one giant head
So they could watch all around them as they talked while they read
And they never knew nothing of love, it was before, oh
The origin of love (origin of love)
The origin of love (origin of love)

Now there was three sexes then, one that looked like two men glued up back-to-back
They called “the children of the Sun”
And similar in shape and girth was “the children of the Earth”, they looked like
Two girls rolled up in one
And “the children of the Moon”
Was like a fork shoved on a spoon
They was part-Sun, part-Earth, part-daughter, part-son
Pa-la-la-la, the origin of love

Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
And Thor said, “I’m gonna kill them all with my hammer like I killed the giants”
But Zeus said, “No, you better let me use my lightning like scissors,
like I cut the legs off the whales, dinosaurs into lizards”
And then he grabbed up some bolts, he let out a laugh
Said, “I’ll split them right down the middle, gonna cut them right up in half”
And the storm clouds gathered above
Into great balls of fire…
And then fire shot down from the sky in bolts like shining blades of a knife
And it ripped right through the flesh of the children of the Sun and the Moon and the Earth
And some Indian god sewed the wound up into a hole
Pulled it ’round to our bellies to remind us the price we paid
And Osiris and the gods of the Nile gathered up a big storm
To blow a hurricane
To scatter us away
In a flood of wind and rain
And sea of tidal waves
To wash us all away
And if we don’t behave
They’ll cut us down again
And we’ll be hopping around on one foot
And looking through one eye

Last time I saw you, we just split in two
You was looking at me, I was looking at you
You had a way so familiar I could not recognize
’Cause you had blood on your face, I had blood in my eyes
But I could swear by your expression
That the pain down in your soul was the same
As the one down in mine
That’s the pain
That cuts a straight line down through the heart
We call it “love”
We wrapped our arms around each other
Trying to shove ourselves back together
We was making love, making love
It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
When by the mighty hand of Jove
It was a sad story how we became lonely two-legged creatures
That story, the origin of love, that’s the origin of love (oh yeah)
The origin of love
The origin of love
The origin of love…
