I’m winning, you’re losing
I’m falling, your agony
Lower than lower, before
Your forgotten memory

My heaven, your hell
I’m killing your fantasy
More and more, you follow
Your divorced reality

You’re trying to take me
You’re trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I’m tired of trying
I’m tired of lying
The only thing I understand
Is what I feel

Identity, fantasy, heresy
Killing me lower than lower
Before
This thing to feed
Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
More and more
You follow
Your divorced reality

You’re trying to take me
You’re trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I’m tired of trying
I’m tired of lying
The only thing I understand
Is what I feel

Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic
Hypocrite, lunatic, fanatic, heretic

You’re trying to take me
You’re trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I’m tired of trying
I’m tired of lying
The only thing I understand
Is what I feel

You’re trying to take me
You’re trying to make me
This is the only
Give me the only thing
I’m tired of trying
I’m tired of lying
The only thing I understand
Is what I feel
