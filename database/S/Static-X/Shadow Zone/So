So, I’ve betrayed self
So, I’ve betrayed you
So, what now?
So, what do we do?

Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me
Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me

So, I’m… I’m confused
So, you’re not amused?
So, I’m feeling used
So, what do we do?

Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me
Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me

Empty inside, I’m dying, I’m crying
She makes me bad, betrays my head
Empty inside, I’m dying, I’m crying
She makes me bad…

Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me
Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me

Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me
Pushing you away, pushing you away
Pushing you away, away from me

Empty inside, I’m dying, I’m crying
She makes me bad, betrays my head
Empty inside, I’m dying, I’m crying
She makes me bad…
