Galaxies are ... ... screams
These crimes are all over vision screens
And the nightmares are holding our future tears
Here comes that rain, that rain of ruin

Yeah I’m the keeper-keeper of the flame

... ... stage
It’s running and hiding the freezing rage
The more I’m turning (the?)into suffering age
Here comes that rain
That rain of the ruin

Yeah it’s the keeper-keeper of the flame

(Bite!)

Cheap futures bleed in eternity
There’s another ... hold my true love
As suffering lies with the sunrise
(Bite!)
Sunrise

Holding terror interest, they’re killing time
Prophets of speeds giving us signs / sign?
The fake and the wild, here comes the snake
Here comes that rain, that rain of ruin

Yeah it’s the keeper-keeper of the flame

Galaxies are flickering in the ... of reigns/rage
Its crimes are all over vision screens
And the nightmare doesn’t hold the future tears
Here comes that rain, that rain of ruin

Yeah it’s the keeper-keeper… of the flame!
