Hold me now I need to feel relief
Like I never wanted anything
I suppose I’ll let this go and find a reason I’ll hold on to
I’m so ashamed of defeat

And I’m out of reason to believe in me
I’m out of trying to get by

I’m so afraid of the gift you give me
I don’t belong here and I’m not well
I’m so ashamed of the lie I’m living
Right on the wrong side of it all

I can’t face myself when I wake up and look inside a mirror
I’m so ashamed of that thing
I suppose I’ll let it go till I have something more to say for me
I’m so afraid of defeat

And I’m out of reason to believe in me
I’m out of trying to defy

I’m so afraid of the gift you give me
I don’t belong here and I’m not well
I’m so ashamed of the lie I’m living
Right on the wrong side of it all

Hold me now I need to feel complete
Like I matter to the one I need

I’m so afraid of the gift you give me
I don’t belong here and I’m not well
I’m so ashamed of the lie I’m living
Right on the wrong side of it all

Now I’m ashamed of this
I am so ashamed of this
Now I’m so ashamed of this
I am so ashamed of me
