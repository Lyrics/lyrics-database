Here she’s coming and she’s drunk again
She’s only seventeen
Her daddy said "Well that’s enough of that
Come be my little queen"

And now he’s touching her wrong again
He’s gonna give her disease
He never wanted it anyway
He only does as he please

Won’t you tell her that I said I’m the one
I couldn’t hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I’m the one
And I don’t deserve her

Here he’s coming and he’s drunk again
He’s on amphetamines
Scratch his nails down the other leg
’Cause you’re my little queen

And now he’s touching her wrong again
She’s only trying to get by
He never wanted it anyway
He never soils the child

Won’t you tell her that I said I’m the one
I couldn’t hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I’m the one
And I don’t deserve her

Won’t you tell her that I said I’m the one
I couldn’t hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I’m the one
And I don’t deserve her

We’re coming for you
You

Won’t you tell her that I said I’m the one
I couldn’t hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I’m the one
And I don’t deserve her

Won’t you tell her that I said I’m the one
I couldn’t hurt her like everyone
And tell her that I said I’m the one
And I don’t deserve her
