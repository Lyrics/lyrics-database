Leave your mark under my skin
Oh my, how strong you are
Then feast your eyes on my disdain
And hope this one won’t scar

I will never belong to you… again
I will never belong to you

Push if you still need my pain
Cause I will never tell
And scream if you still hate my name
Cause I’ll be where I fell

Come sit close to me
(Let me feel your breath)
Come sit close to me
(Hands around my neck)
Come sit close to me
(Let me feel your breath)
Come sit close to me
Close to me

I will never belong to you… again
I will never belong to you

If I decide that I am alive
Then I’m diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Then I’m diseased, so push it in
Till it breaks
If I bleed, I’ll be okay

If I decide that I am alive
Then I’m diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Then I’m diseased and ungrateful
If I decide that I am alive
Then I’m diseased and ungrateful
If I confide that I am a liar
Then I’m diseased

So sit close to me
So sit close to me
Come sit close to me
Come sit close to me
