Must be something they’re hiding
Must be reasons that no one will dare to tell
Must be something inside me
But I don’t think so anymore
It’s hurting again now
And I don’t need friends when I have foes like you
It’s hurting again now
It’s killing me to be here all alone

Go away
It’s all the same
There’s more for me

As the world falls away, and I can’t find a reason
As the world turns to grey
It’s killing me unwillingly and I am just the same as you

Must be something confided
Must be someway to feel the pain and heal again
Pain and pleasure inviting
I don’t think so anymore
It’s hurting again now
And I don’t need pills when I have drugs like you
It’s hurting again now
It’s killing me to be here all alone

Go away
It’s all the same
There’s more for me

As the world falls away, and I can’t find a reason
As the world turns to grey
It’s killing me unwillingly and I am just afraid

As the world falls away, and I can’t find a reason
As the world turns to grey
You’re killing me unwillingly and I am just the same as you
As you

I’m just like you, just not a fool
I’m just like you, just not as cool
I’m just like you, just not a fool
I’m just like you

As the world falls away, and I can’t find a reason
As the world turns to grey
It’s killing me unwillingly and I am just afraid

As the world falls away, and I can’t find a reason
As the world turns to grey
You’re killing me unwillingly and I am just the same as you

I’m just like you, just not a fool
I’m just like you
Shut up
