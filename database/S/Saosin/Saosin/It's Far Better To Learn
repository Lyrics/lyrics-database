You'd better learn that this will not blow over
And over
High above, they're taking over you
And you should know
I will not let you go
(Let you go)

What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
There's something greater there
What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
It's not gonna change you

We walk along but never turn to see what we have done
(What we have done)
We choose our moves so carefully for you
(Carefully for you)
I will not let you go
(Let you go)

What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
There's something greater there
What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
It's not gonna change you

What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
It's not gonna change you

Why believe in nothing
Why believe in nothing at all

Why believe in nothing
Why believe in nothing at all

What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
There's something greater there
What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
It's not gonna change you

What is my body worth?
What is my body worth?
