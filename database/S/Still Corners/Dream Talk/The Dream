We are on a night train
Heading to the East End
Waiting for the time
Looking for a sign

The waves are green
The moon like a jewel
On the Nile
We are on the Nile

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And you know all’s not
What it seems

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And maybe it’s a
Dream within a dream

As quick as light
A shadow moves
In your eyes
It’s all in your eyes

The endless sands
Stretch far away
I don’t understand
I don’t understand

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And you know all’s not
What it seems

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And maybe it’s a
Dream within a dream

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And you know all’s not
What it seems

We’re in a dream
We’re in a dream
And maybe it’s a
Dream within a dream

We’re in a dream

We’re in a dream
