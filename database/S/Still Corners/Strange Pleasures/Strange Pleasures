Your heart beats fast
This love will kill
Your heart beats fast
This love will kill

As deep as you
In deep blue sky (we both want to fall in love)
As deep as you
In deep blue nights (it’s a crazy ride)

(Ride)
(Ride)
(Ride)
(Ride)

You drift along
The desert sun
You drift along
The desert sun

As deep as you
In deeper nights (we both want to fall in love)
You drift along
With desert eyes (it’s a crazy ride)

(Ride)
(Ride)
(Ride)
(Ride)

(Ha-aah)
(Ha-aah)

(Ha-aah)
(Ha-aah)
