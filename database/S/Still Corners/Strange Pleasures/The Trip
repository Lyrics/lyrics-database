Time has come to go
Pack your bags, hit the open road
Our hearts just won’t die
It’s the trip that keeps us alive

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Away

They’re following, some dance in light
Tearing into the night
Watching you fall asleep
The sweetest dove in a dream

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh

So many miles
So many miles
So many miles
Away
