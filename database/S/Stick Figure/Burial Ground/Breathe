Hey, so here we are
Beneath the moon, the rising sun and stars
It’s a brand new day, it’s a brand new start
To greet the world, it’s just me and my guitar

When you feel alone, when you feel afraid
Don’t hesitate to call my name
’Cause I’ll be there, be there for you
’Cause I’ll be there when you’re feeling blue

Breathe and take it in
Breathe, take it in
Breathe and take it in
Breathe, take it in

From the hillside and to the seas
From the mountains, to the trees
There’s this place I long to be
And if I asked you, would you come with me?

Well, I don’t care what they say
I’d leave it all behind and move away
Won’t you help me make my dreams come true?
Won’t you love me like I love you?

Breathe and take it in
Breathe, take it in
Breathe and take it in
Breathe, take it all in (all in)

Ram-pam-param, ram-pam-para-pam
Ram-pam-param, ram-pam-para-pam
Ram-pam-param, ram-pam-para-pam
Ram-pam-param, ram-pam-para-pam

It’s so easy lovin’ you
Why do you make it so hard to do?
It’s so easy lovin’ you
Why do you make it so hard to do?

So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do
So hard to do

Can yo hear me, can you feel me?
It’s alright, well if you only knew
Won’t you hold me, won’t you love me?
Oh, I’m still loving you, oh why?
