I hear a voice say, “Don’t be so blind”
It’s telling me all these things that you would probably hide
Am I your one and only desire?
Am I the reason you breathe, or am I the reason you cry?

Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can’t live without you!
I love you, I hate you, I can’t get around you
I breathe you, I taste you, I can’t live without you

I just can’t take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I’m out the door
And now I’m done with you

(Done with you) done with you, done with you, done with you (done with you)

I feel like you don’t want me around
I guess I’ll pack all my things, I guess I’ll see you around
It’s all been bottled up until now
As I walk out your door, all I can hear is the sound

Always, always, always, always, always, always
I just can’t live without you!
I love you, I hate you, I can’t get around you
I breathe you, I taste you, I can’t live without you

I just can’t take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I’m out the door
And now I’m done with you

I love you, I hate you, I can’t live without you

I wrapped my hand around your heart
Why would you tear my world apart?!

Always, always, always, always

I see the blood all over your hands
Does it make you feel more like a man?
Was it all just a part of your plan?
The pistol’s shakin’ in my hands, and all I hear is the sound

I love you, I hate you, I can’t live without you
I breathe you, I taste you, I can’t live without you

I just can’t take any more
This life of solitude
I guess that I’m out the door
And now I’m done with you

I love you, I hate you, I can’t live without you
I love you, I hate you, I can’t live without you

I just can’t take any more
This life of solitude
I pick myself off the floor
And now I’m done with you

Always, always, always
