Fingers hear whispers
I blindly reach
For you
Only for you

I hold it close to my breath
Your sustenance
Your goodbye kiss
But you won’t live without me

Moon-soaked rising waters
Carry my love to you
So calm the sea, you succumb to me
Floating into my arms

I hold it close to my breath
Your sustenance
Your goodbye kiss
But you won’t survive without me

’Cause I gave you my heart
My heart

Soft I wait through each night
I still remember the thought of your skin
The touch of your voice whispering my name
Why did we drift, why did we drift apart?

I hold it close to my breath
Your sustenance
Your goodbye kiss
But you, I can’t live without you

’Cause I gave you my heart
My heart
