I will be here when you are gone
So I have the right to a power gorge
And I will be good at making bad
And I’ll light the way for the fucking mad
I will defeat what I’m heading for
And I will be here for evermore
And I am the way of your empty shell
I want more than I am

’Cause I was made to fly
’Cause I was made to fly
And you were made to die
But I was made to fly

I will survive ’cause I want more
And I will create a bigger war
And I will rule over and give you hell
And then you will do as I command
’Cause I will be here when you are gone
Yeah I’ll still be here when you are gone
I’ll fill you with fear of the holy son
I want all that I am

’Cause I was made to fly
Yeah, I was made to fly
You were made to die
But I was made to fly

I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you
I will defeat you

Manipulate, interrogate, compete all you like
And dominate with forceful hate
’Cause you know (I will defeat you)

You were made to fly
Yeah, you were made to fly
I was made to fly
But you were made to die
’Cause I was made to fly
Yeah, I was made to fly
And you were made to fly
But I was made to fly

I will defeat you
