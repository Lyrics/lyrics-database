I remember you back in ’83
Singing in the rain
In sweet harmony
(I get so lonely)

As the pages turn in my history
You fade away like a mystery
(I get so lonely)

Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is in your arms
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is where you are
I will never leave you (leave you)
I will never let you go

If you never come back into my life
I’ll cut these strings with a golden knife
(I won’t be lonely, I won’t be lonely)

I’ll steal your body from the hall of fame
So the U.S.A. will know my name
(I get so lonely, I get so lonely)

Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is in your arms
I will never let you go (I will never let you go)
I will never let you go
Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is where you are (is where you are)
I will never leave you
I will never let you go

I read in this month’s Passion magazine
Or was I just imagining things?
It seemed so real (seemed so real, seemed so real)
I’ve got something that you left behind
A picture of you in my mind

(I get so…)
Heaven
(I get so lonely)

Heaven is in your arms, dear…

Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is in your arms
I will never let you go
I will never let you go
Heaven is in your arms, dear
Heaven is where you are
I will never leave you
I will never let you go
