I’m just trying for
What’s the point in it all
Where you fighting your battles
Are you on my side?
I’m done crying for
Moments I once adored
Why is all this in pieces
Can’t you let it lie?

Leave love alone
Water under my skin
We are a long way from home
Water under

In every step and all your work you’ve made
I knew you’d take it back all along say the words I don’t want to feel
In every step and all your work you’ve made
Leave it I can’t bear sleeping alone

Leave love alone
Water under my skin
Looked for a long time
For me
I guess it’s all a memory
I lost a bet, a bet
Here
All I fear is
Dying
Alone alone
