Desperate, deranged
Talking in my sleep again
Eyes twitch, retain
A sentimental something
Looked torn
And we burned and burned
I was a cinder body soul
In my dream

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Responding disillusion
Encrusted cruelty
Describe why nails enclose me
Eating oh so easily
But there exists a lot of reasons
To support fatality

Abstinence possessed
Hardly what you think it is
Hearts beat, positive
(My heart beat)
Provided there’s progress
Ignorance does insist
Of the right coffin
Took some food, offered me
Can’t see myself, drank the wine
Wished the feverish burst of terror

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Insist that nothing happened
Chilled bloodless fatigue
Recharge with bitterness
Fanatics beckoning
Mistook a look impassioned
Absorbed with clarity

Consciousness
Drifts away
(From me)
Discarded memory
Packaged shelf life
Bad display

Breakdown amid the mixtures
Avoid addictive plea
Insist that nothing happened
Chilled bloodless fatigue
So pound the nails in tight
Eyes screaming out of sight
Against the grain like curtain
Unbearably alive

Misty eyed
