In nervous convulsion crouches infant ape
Trembling in mother’s shit
Caged, eyes tearless, filled with contempt
Clinic mask, experiment with life and death

Smell, lingering, noxious, mixed scent, anxiety
Omnipotent doctor grinds the cage door
Revealing love’s primal instinct taken away
The tiny face terrified

Rant and rave, smash your head against the cage
Vacuum clicks on high

Conscious through the pain, pass off as humane
White coat seems so clean
Most dirt bleached out
Out of greed

Force the point of habit,
Eyes burn in a rabbit
Push the pain test button
Spine’s cut

Trip mucous inflection, more die
Pills each day
What goes around comes back stronger
Tap into the brain, break the skull again

Smash, price, research rat, lab rent paid in flesh
More ill, drug store sales, sharpen the knife
Emphasis on money, new disease every day
End is seen and coming, research turns its back to gain

Crush the spine, genocide
Kitten drags its dead limb
Continuing all suffering
It will come back and win

Shock, paralyze, turn trauma
Burns out the will to live
The lying message
Five year genocide
1945
Suicide
Vivisect VI
