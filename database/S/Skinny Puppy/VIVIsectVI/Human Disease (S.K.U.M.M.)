Whatever
Painted part
Taught, deeply enclosed in
Mother Earth

Life born, addict, breathe angel
Whatever, paint it up
So close up to farther apart
Meat-seeking missiles consuming rainforest
Meat-seeking missiles consuming…

Infested veins
The river flows
Urban needle
Inject carcinogen
Chemicals relieve the stress
Slows consumer rotting
Sight, no taste, odorless
Clear, seeping, water-poisoning
All producing nothing
Intelligent to cause disease
Human breeding’s self-perpetuating

Whatever
Close at hand
Finger cramp
... closet problem
Epileptic machine shudder
Shock, boom!
Who is over
Who is on top
Who is over
Who is on top

Malformed earthborn
Malformed earthborn

Shake!

All is a disease (all is a disease)
Biped walks so straight
All is a disease (all is a disease)
Biped walks so straight

Earth can be as giving as it can be irate
Earth can be as giving as it can be irate!

All a disease
Biped walks so straight
All a disease
Biped walks so straight
All a disease

Earth can be so giving, as it can be irate
Earth can be so giving, as it can be irate!

All a disease
All a disease
All a disease

Wipe it out
To burn up and out
Up and out
With killing over doubt
(Up and out)
Killing over doubt

Sight, no taste, odorless, FDA recommends
To drink daily allowance (allow it)
Twenty six unknown carcinogens
Twenty six unknown cancer-causing supplements
No taste (no sight)
No taste
No taste
No taste!

Infested
(I don’t even wanna drink the water but I keep drinking it, it seems like…)
Chemicals, FDA
(If I think about it, I might do something, but I don’t do anything, I just drink the water)
Revolution, evolution
(I just drink more and more)
(I just drink)

(revolution evolution, revolution evolution, revolution)

... closet problem

Whatever
Toothbrush
... self-destruct
(whatever)
Destruct the so called
Lesser beast
Exhibits harmony

Walk straight, biped, relate (walk straight)
Walk straight, biped, relate
Walking disease
Walking disease

Walk straight, biped
All are disease
All are disease
All are disease
A lesser beast exhibits harmony

So-called beast
So-called lesser beast
So-called lesser beast
So-called beast

All is a disease
Human disease

All
Human disease
(survival is)
