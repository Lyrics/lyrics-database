I am the liar’s nation, oh yeah
I am the undisputed god, oh yeah
I am the maggot’s muscle, magnet missle, your mother’s pisshole
Magnifishit, master of it all, oh yeah, oh yeah
Master of it all, oh yeah, oh yeah

I am the answer’s question, oh yeah
I am the undisputed lie, oh yeah
I am the greatest lesson’s, righteous person’s, raving servant’s
Makes it worse and altogether bad, oh yeah
Bad, oh yeah

I am the infant’s nightmare, (I am) oh yeah
I am the infinite disguise, (I am) oh yeah
I am the greatest person to hate the small one’s only leisure
Due to scrape and eat behind my lies
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Master of it all, oh yeah, oh yeah
Master of it all, oh yeah, oh yeah
Master of it all, oh yeah, oh yeah
Master of it all

Home sinking, full of blood
What’s going on, is something wrong?
All the armies fighting in our house

Oh yeah, oh yeah, master of it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, master of it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, master of it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, master of it all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, master of it all

Master of it all
