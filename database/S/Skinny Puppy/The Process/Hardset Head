Event width
Two path given
Pure force downs
Turns a screw
Crawling back

In turn space
A time to intrude
In turn peace
Assuring a future

Silent noise forming sound like silent noise
Silent noise screaming hints retaliation

Heinous plans in sides remain
Taking downs, taking aim
Filling curses
Two conditions back upon itself

Pass it off as good intentions
Leaving marks hard to heal
Reassisted retrogressions
Leaving tracks, path reveals
Sample act, reflected clears
Noticed nought while leaving hears
Nuisance labels paranoia
So stupid how perceived that way

Silent clause shredding flaws
Hungers knawing
Silent flaws
Forever laughter silence knows

A shaman stands retreating
All is over, evermore
Smoke the curse
Your creation back upon yourself

Pushes distress
Closer to the edge
One time cracks
Lights the walls

Worry wasted hearing clouds
Up above the chatter
Digging deep insider storms
To find the inner patience

Erasing shadowed gifted ruin
Haste retracing promised news
Leaving statement meant as nothing
Starving your words with no excuses

Excuses
Excuses
Excuses for excuses
Excuses for excuses

Silent truth asserts its proof like you abhor
Silent truth asserts its proof
You abhor
Abhor

Silent noise

Silent clause
Silent noise
Silent voice
Silent flaws
Silent truth
Silent pause
Silent noise
Silent voice
