Here falls, now undone, looks beyond the credits’ sum
Livid fractures, less of fate, the whisper, winds blow the seed of hate

Disturbed society dogs my turn with no values
Intend to raise ability
I tried and tested pointless view
God’s got security
Hands like snakes sow the seeds

Raise all negative force-fed traces, poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven, jeering leapt into the pit of calamity

A mean condition, no wealth dents, provisions for a time unknown
Thelemic gestures, all planned and hatched, seasons of dissolute pain

I cried afflicted and infected
Oblige the system’s perfect dream
Distorted my words
Assume all that is programmed before me and somewhat left unsaid behind shutters

Dirt before desire
Dusted crap, ingested comes
Stealing life that you are not visited
Warped torpedo, night crawls through

The distant and irrelevant, a good life’s experiment fused
I’m laying violent hands upon a dead card calling cattle
The playthings are so abused

The derelict dial-phone clock-pusher
Delved in reliving the future, too
I’m sticking pins and needles in this stinging rotten fleshlike substitute pieces of half-cooked meat that are
Walking on this earth
Abort desire irrelevance
Ticks in front in view
Ticks in front in view
Ticks in front in view

A candle rhyme to realign, burnt out shutters on the wall, seize the moment… reach!
