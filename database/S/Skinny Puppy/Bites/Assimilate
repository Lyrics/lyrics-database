Oil remove
Shred, tear
Radiation, vapor air
It’s the fear
So unclear
Man in motion
Going nowhere
In our homes
Stuck in the face
Spread the dirt to populace
Yellow journal, yellow journal
Set the pace, feel the rage
Manifestations of a sort
So insidious, off the point
Simple solution
Never confusion
Sport a gun, kill a cop
Crazy world of weary thought
So receive me, had enough
Lock me up!
Lock me up!

Rot and assimilate
Hot to annihilate

(Tear your face)
Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate
(Hit with mace)

[Is it safe?]

Deviation, tonic mess
Prolonged existence, innocence
See he who speaks
Isn’t weak
Wheelchair, future so to speak
Bubonic plague
The truth of AIDS
Community, avoid decay
In the trench of pestilence
The bible screams
Announce your faith
Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal
It’s all sensation
Protect design
The moral plan
Infallible
As propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Hot to assimilate
[...] (go nowhere)
Rot or annihilate

Hot to assimilate
(Tear yourself)
We’ll rot or annihilate
(Search your soul)

Agony
Inner-thinking brain
Clanking change
Growing pain

[Is it safe?]

(Bloodshot)

Mutterings of death to bring
Suffocate a newborn thing
Degradation of an age
Venereal
It’s all sensation

Protect design
The moral plan
Infallible
No propaganda
Completely black
With no steps back

Agony profusely stains
The inner thinking of the brain
... Accusations
Clanking change
Experiments with groans of pain
It’s all preferred that no one blames
The terror in an animal screams
In cages our future
The answer’s insane

Rot and assimilate
(Show no faith)
So hot to annihilate
(Each must assimilate)

Rot and assimilate
So hot to annihilate
(Each born assimilates)

(Reach for an airway)
(Reach for an airway)
(Reach for an airway)
(Reach for an airway)
(Reach for an airway)
(Reach for an airway)

Death, death, death,
Death, death, death,
Death, death, death,
Death, death, death,
Death!
