Talk to me
Want my love
Talk to me
But not that stuff

You ain’t enough
Using my love
You call for me
Again I see

In the heat of the night (you lose your heart and sell your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (it’s much too late to leave the trade)
But I can’t stand it anymore (you lose your heart, it’s your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (in the heat of the night)

Talk to me
Want my love
Talk to me
But not that stuff

Who’s on my side?
Losing my pride
You call for me
Again I see

In the heat of the night (you lose your heart and sell your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (it’s much too late to leave the trade)
But I can’t stand it anymore (you lose your heart, it’s your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (in the heat of the night)

In the heat of the night (you lose your heart and sell your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (it’s much too late to leave the trade)
But I can’t stand it anymore (you lose your heart, it’s your soul)
I lose control in the heat of the night (in the heat of the night)
