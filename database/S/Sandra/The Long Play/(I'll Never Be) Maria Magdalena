You take my love
You want my soul
I would be crazy to share your life
Why can’t you see what I am?
Sharpen your senses and turn the knife
Hurt me and you’ll understand

I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)
I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

Why must I lie?
Find alibis?
When will you wake up and realize
I can’t surrender to you?
Play for affection and win the prize?
I know those party games too

I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)
I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)
I’ll never be Maria Magdalena
(You’re a creature of the night)
Maria Magdalena
(You’re a victim of the fight, you need love)
Promise me delight
(You need love)
