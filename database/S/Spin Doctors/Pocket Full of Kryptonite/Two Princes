One, two princes kneel before you
That’s what I said now
Princes, princes who adore you
Just go ahead now
One has diamonds in his pockets
And that’s some bread, now
This one said he wants to buy you rackets
Ain’t in his head, now

This one, he got a princely racket
That’s what I said now
Got some big seal upon his jacket
Ain’t in his head now
You marry him, your father will condone you
How ’bout that now?
You marry me, your father will disown you
He’ll eat his hat, now

Marry him or marry me
I’m the one that loves you baby can’t you see?
Ain’t got no future or family tree
But I know what a prince and lover ought to be
I know what a prince and lover ought be

Said if you want to call me baby
Just go ahead now
And if you’d like to tell me maybe
Just go ahead now
And if you wanna buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
And if you like to talk for hours
Just go ahead now

Oooh!
Just, just go ahead now
Oooh, your majesty!
Just go ahead now
Come on forget the king who… marry me!
Just go ahead now
Come on, come on, come on
Just go ahead now
Go ahead now

If you want to buy me flowers
Just go ahead now
