If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I’d burn this whole building down

Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
She had good looks and coal black hair
Delilah, she gained ground on Samson’s mind
When he saw this woman, she looked so fine
Delilah, she climbed up on Samson’s knee
Said, “tell me where your strength lies, if you please”
Then she spoke so kind and she talked so fair
Till Samson said, “Delilah, cut off my hair
You can shave my head clean as my hand
And my strength becomes as natural as any man”

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I’d burn this whole building down

People read about old Samson, as far back as his birth
He was the strongest man that ever lived on earth
One day while Samson’s walking, walking alone
Looked down on the ground and saw an old jawbone
And he stretched out his arms and his chains broke like thread
When he got to move, ten thousand men was dead

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I’d burn this whole building down
If I had my way (if I had my way)
If I had my way (if I had my way)
If I had my way
I’d burn this building down

Little Samson and the lion got entwined in a fight
And Samson, he jumped up and took on the lion’s might
You all know just how a lion can kill a man with his paws
Well, Samson got his hands up round that lion’s jaws
And he ripped that beast and he killed him dead
And the bees made honey in the lion’s head

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I’d burn this whole building down
If I had my way (if I had my way)
If I had my way (if I had my way)
If I had my way
I would burn this building down

If I had my way
If I had my way
If I had my way
I’d burn this whole building down
