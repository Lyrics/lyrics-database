I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone

A'try to make your mark in society
You're using all the tricks that you used on me
I read aboutcha baby in your magazines
Clothes you're wearin' they're
Worn at the seams

I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone

When I first met you girl you had no shoes
And now you're walking round like you're front page news
You've been unfaithful with the friends that you choose
You won't find me in your book of fools

I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I'm not a stepping stone
I'm not stoned again
I'm not a crook (?)

I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone

You're trying to make your mark in society
You're using all the tricks that you used on me
I read aboutcha baby in those magazines
The clothes you're wearin' is
worn at the seams

I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone

I yi yi yi yi I'm not your stepping stone
I yi yi yi yi Stoned again
Not your stepping stone
Stoned again
Not your rolling stone
Not your four pink walls
Waste of time
Not your stone

Now what?
