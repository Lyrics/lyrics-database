Feels like a lifetime ago
I dit it with my wife.
I didn’t have a codom,
so I went and rolled the dice.

Turnes out that she got pregnant
and wanted to keep the thing.
Now I have this tubby, moronic child
Whose neck I want to wring!

I’m abandoning my kid at the airport,
Gonna leave ’em in Terminal B!
I am fucking done with this stupid kid,
Get ’em the hell away from me!

This kid is dumb as a pile of rocks,
And his mom doesn’t disagree.
He spends all his time watching YouTube clips,
What the fuck is a skibidi?

I wanna ryp off my goddamn ears,
Will you please turn off “Baby Shark”?
Lord above, did you just shit your pants?
There was a bathroom at the park.

I’m abandoning my kid at the airport,
Gonna leave ’em in Terminal B!
We’re not goign to Disney, you stupid brat,
Get the fuck away from me!

No, I don’t have an iPad charger,
Will you please leave me alone?
It’s not my fault you’re a total SPED
And forgot your goddamn phone.

He thinks we’re going on vacation,
What a fucking stupid bitch!
Push him out the car and hit the gas,
Leave his dumb ass in the ditch.

I’m abandoning my kid at the airport,
Gonna leave ’em in Terminal B!
Have fun being homeless, you stupid cunt,
I’m finally fucking free!

Oh yeah!

Oh yeah
