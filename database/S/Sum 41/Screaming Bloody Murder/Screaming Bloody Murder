I’m not quite myself these days
Guess we all come undone
Time to time in different ways, well
I have myself to blame
Guess I don’t understand, I need help in many ways

God’s got a plan for me
Well I’m gonna tell you one thing
I don’t got the patience, or the time
What can I say?
I’m no angel
I’m not forsaken,
But I can bleed

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it’s meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream

Well I guess it’s time for me
Tell me what I’m left to believe in?
Cause I don’t know the concept
Of the pain

I don’t want the faith
I’ll just lose it
I can prove it
Watch me bleed

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it’s meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream
God will send you all to tear me open!

’Cause I’m
Not giving up
No self control
Suffocating to the bone
I’m my worst enemy
Who can’t be saved
I’m just his disgrace

Tear me open, I believe
God will set you up to bleed
And no one can deceive
What it’s meant to be and
"Bloody Murder" we will scream
God will send you all to tear me open!

These days are strange it’s true.
There’s not a thing that I would change,
no mistakes that I’d undo.
