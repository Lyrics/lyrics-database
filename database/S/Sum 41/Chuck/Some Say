Some say we’re never meant to grow up
I’m sure they never knew enough
I know the pressures won’t go away
It’s too late

Find out we’re different somehow
It’s too late to even have faith
Don’t think things will ever change
You must be dreaming

Think before you make up your mind
You don’t seem to realize
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I’ll take it all
It’s so easy after all

Believe me ’cause now’s the time to try
Don’t wait, the chance will pass you by
Time’s up to figure it out
You can’t say it’s too late

Seems like everything we knew
Turned out we’re never even true
Don’t trust, things will never change
You must be dreaming

Think before you make up your mind
You don’t seem to realise
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I’ll take it all
It’s so easy after all

Some say we’re better off without
Knowing what life is all about
I’m sure they’ll never realize the way
It’s too late

Somehow it’s different everyday
In some ways it never fades away
Seems like it’s never gonna change
I must be dreaming

Think before you make up your mind
You don’t seem to realize
I can do this on my own

Think before you make up your mind
You don’t seem to realize
I can do this on my own
And if I fall I’ll take it all
It’s so easy after all

Believe me, it’s alright
It’s so easy after all
Believe me, it’s alright
It’s so easy after all
