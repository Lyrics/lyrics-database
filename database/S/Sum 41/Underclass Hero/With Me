I don’t want this moment
To ever end
Where everything’s nothing
Without you
I wait here forever just to
To see you smile
Cause it’s true
I am nothing without you

Through it all
I made my mistakes
I’ll stumble and fall
But I mean these words

I want you to know
With everything I won’t let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I’ll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won’t let go

Thoughts read unspoken
Forever and now
And pieces of memories
Fall to the ground
I know what I didn’t have so
I won’t let this go
Cause it’s true
I am nothing without you

All the streets
Where I walked alone
With nowhere to go
Have come to an end

I want you to know
With everything I won’t let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I’ll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won’t let go

In front of your eyes
It falls from the skies
When you don’t know what you’re looking to find
In front of your eyes
It falls from the skies
When you just never know what you will find
What you will find
What you will find
What you will find
What you will find

I don’t want this moment
To ever end
Where everything’s nothing
Without you

I want you to know
With everything I won’t let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I’ll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won’t let go

I want you to know
With everything I won’t let this go
These words are my heart and soul
I’ll hold onto this moment you know
Cause I bleed my heart out to show
That I won’t let go.
