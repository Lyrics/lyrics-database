Kool thing, sittin’ with a kitty
Now you know you’re sure lookin’ pretty
Like a lover, not a dancer
Superboy, take a little chance here

I don’t wanna
I don’t think so
I don’t wanna
I don’t think so

Kool thing, let me play it with your radio
Move me, turn me on, baby-o
I’ll be your slave
Give you a shave

I don’t wanna
I don’t think so
I don’t wanna
I don’t think so

(Yeah)
(Tell ’em ’bout it)
(Hit ’em where it hurts)
Hey, kool thing, come here
Sit down beside me
There’s something I gotta ask you
I just wanna know, what are you gonna do for me?
I mean, are you gonna liberate us girls
From male white corporate oppression?
(Tell it like it is)
Huh?
(Yeah)
Don’t be shy
(Word up)
Fear of a female planet
(Fear of a female planet)
(Fear it, baby)
I just want you to know that we can still be friends
(Let everybody know)
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Kool thing
Kool thing

When you’re a star
I know that you’ll fix everything

Kool thing, sittin’ with a kitty
Now you know you’re sure lookin’ pretty
Rock the beat just a little faster
Now I know you are a master

I don’t wanna
I don’t think so
I don’t wanna
I don’t think so

Kool thing, walkin’ like a panther
Come on and give me an answer
Kool thing, walkin’ like a panther
What’d he say?

I don’t wanna
I don’t think so
I don’t wanna
I don’t think so
