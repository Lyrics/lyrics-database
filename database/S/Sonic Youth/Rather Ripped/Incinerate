I ripped your heart out from your chest
Replaced it with a grenade blast

Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate

The firefighters hose me down
I don’t care, I’ll burn out anyhow
It’s for alarm, girl, nothing to see
Hear the sirens come for me

You dosed my soul with gasoline
You flicked a match into my brain

Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate

The firefighters are so nice
I remember you so cold as ice
Now flames are licking at your feet
Sirens come to put me out of misery

You wave your torch into my eyes
Flamethrower lover, burning mind

Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate
Incinerate, incinerate
