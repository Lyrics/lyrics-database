Ha-ha...
Ooo-hoo-hoo

I see you looking at me
From across, consumed by me
Please come on over and tell me your name
You're the one I need so come talk to me

Don't try, don't try to make me ...
Your lust for me, my love
Don't try, don't try to make ...
You're the one I need so come talk to me

There is this place I want to go
It's got other ... people both you and I know
And then I try to take you home
Steal from you my brother's ...

Don't try, don't try to make ...
Your lust for me, my love
Don't try, don't try to make ...
You're the one I need so come talk to me

Don't try, don't try to make ...
Your lust for me, my love
Don't try, don't try to make ...
You're the one I need so come talk to me

Now my need for you is gone
You are nothing to me — just another pawn
Tomorrow ... be ... gonna home
For another sacrifice [— road to freedom / or two — freedom / or to freedom]

Don't try, don't try to make ...
Your lust for me, my love
Don't try, don't try to make ...
You're the one I need so come talk to me

Don't try, don't try to make ...
Your lust for me, my love
Don't try, don't try to make ...
You're the one I need so come talk to me

[Well... so much for the cat and mouse shit]
