Your taste, your face, how do I recognize your ways
Leather and lace reminds me of a better place

Moving quickly up the walls, the ravenous spirit inside us all
Children of the night break free your chains
Undaunted take flight, feel it coursing through your veins

Reach inside me, rid me of hate
I want to roam free in an open space
I’m unattainable, looking for release
Intimidating frequently

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free

Your taste, your face, how do I recognize your ways
Breath on my skin, I’m your ancestral sin

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
Don’t hesitate your love for me, don’t give it all up for free
