Spread out? your wings
... as there's night?

They all down there fear you
As you take flight

Intelligence? is gone
You have ...

... incoming
You will look for decoys

Cast stones from above
Unbeknownst to your prayer
... for this place
Comes ...
... know your way
You will always recognize my face

Was it you
Close to sky
...
In the dark?
Was it me
It was you
To return
...

... your eyes
Revealing your lie
Vision's enchanted
When you take flight

Cast stones from above
Unbeknownst to your prayer
... for this place
Comes ...
... know your way
You will always recognize my face

Was it you
Close to sky
...
In the dark?
Was it you
... (moon)?
To return
...
