Ah
Something ain’t right
Gonna get myself, I’m gonna get myself, I’m gonna get myself connected
I ain’t gonna go blind
For the light which is reflected
I see through you, see through you
I see through you, I see through you
Your dirty tricks
You make me sick
I see through you, I see through you

I’m gonna do it again, gonna do it again, ah!
(I’m gonna do it again Gonna do it again)
Gotta do right (gonna do it again)
’Cause something ain’t right (gonna do it again)
Gotta do right
Come on

If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall
Stumble and you might fall

I ain’t gonna go blind
I see through you, see through you
I see through you, I see through you
I’m gonna get myself, I’m gonna get myself, I’m gonna get myself connected
I ain’t gonna go blind
For the light that is reflected
Hear me out
Can ya hear me out, can ya hear me out?

Do it again, do it again, do it again, do it again
Ah
I wanna do it again, I wanna do it again, I wanna do it again
You’re terrified (I wanna do it again)
Ain’t gonna go blind, ain’t gonna go blind (I wanna do it again)
Here we go

If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall
Hear me out
Stumble and you might fall

Interstate 5
Staying alive (ah!)
Won’t someone try
Open up your eyes (ah!)
You must be blind
If you can’t see
The gaping hole
Called reality

I wanna do it again
I’m gonna, gonna do it again, ah
I wanna do it again, come on
I’m gonna do it again
Hear me out
Terrified
Something ain’t right
Here we go

If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall
Stumble and you might fall

(If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall
Stumble and you might fall)

(If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall
Stumble and you might fall)

(If you make sure you’re connected
The writing’s on the wall
But if your mind’s neglected
Stumble and you might fall, stumble and you might fall)
