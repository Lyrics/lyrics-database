No you don’t get it
No, you don’t want it
No, you don’t get it
No

No, you don’t get it
No, you don’t want it
No, you don’t get it
No

She don’t like
The way she smiles
He don’t like
The way she smiles

Son of a bitch
I know what the itch
Is like you won’t get enough
Try to get rid of it
But you won’t, you can’t
You won’t get enough

She don’t like (don’t want you)
The way she smiles (don’t need you)
He don’t like (can’t have you)
The way she smiles (I won’t)

No, you don’t get it
You’ll never get it
No, you don’t get it
I want to see through you

No, you don’t get it
You’ll never get it
No, you don’t get it
I want to see through you

No, you don’t get it
No, you don’t want it
No, you don’t get it
No

Try to get rid of it
But you won’t, you can’t
You won’t get enough

She don’t like (don’t want you)
The way she smiles (don’t need you)
He don’t like (can’t have you)
The way she smiles (I won’t)

No, you don’t get it

She don’t like
The way she smiles
She don’t like
The way she smiles

No, you don’t get it
You’ll get it
No, you don’t get it
I want to see through you

No, you don’t get it
You’ll never get it
No, you don’t want it
I want to see through you

(I broke a string!)
