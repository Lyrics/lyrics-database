My life is over
Over since the night she died
I sit, I sigh, I weep
I’m dying, dying, dying in deep pain

This time it’ll make a difference now
This time it’ll make a difference now
This pain, I think it only gets deep regret
And where I’m going I don’t know now

Shattered
Somebody help me now
My only exit is a
One way out of here

I’ve been shattered
Somebody pull me out
I’m only dying,
I’m only dying

But this time it’s over
Over since the night she died
I sit, I sigh, I weep
I’m dying, dying, dying in deep pain

This time it’ll make a difference now
This time it’ll make a difference now
This pain, I think it only gets deep regret
And where I’m going I don’t know now

Dear God,
I’ll make a change for the better
And my life you can spare ’til tomorrow
I know
Oh, ooh…

Shattered
Somebody help me now
My only exit is a
One way exit out of here

Can’t you see that I’m Shattered?
Somebody pull me out
I’m only dying,
I’m only dying

(Jesus is knocking on the door of your heart today)
