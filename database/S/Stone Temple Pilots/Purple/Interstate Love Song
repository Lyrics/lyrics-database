Waiting on a Sunday afternoon
For what I’ve read between the lines,
Your lies.

Feelin’ like a hand in rusted shame
So do you laugh or does it cry?
Reply?

Leavin’ on a southern train
Only yesterday you lied,
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by,
All of these things you said to me.

Breathing is the hardest thing to do.
With all I’ve said and all that’s dead for you
You lied — goodbye

Leavin’ on a southern train
Only yesterday you lied,
Promises of what I seemed to be
Only watched the time go by,
All of these things I said to you.
