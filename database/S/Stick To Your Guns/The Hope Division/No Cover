the perversion of life through gaia’s eyes as good as dead in the jaws of spite i cant sit back as the apathy amplifies in the darkest corners of their nightmare, I’ll be a light - count our blessings NO COVER showered in life’s warmth THE REST TO SUFFER we are fortunate enough to make a choice COUNT OUR BLESSINGS no cover SHOWERED IN LIFE’S WARMTH the rest to suffer WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAKE A CHOICE ill be a voice - THEY REST THEIR EYES IN A BED OF FILTH AND WE SUFFER SLOW IN A VICE OF GUILT I REFUSE TO ADD TO THIS VIOLENT DESIGN IN THE DARKEST CORNERS OF THEIR NIGHTMARE, I’LL BE A LIGHT - COUNT OUR BLESSINGS no cover SHOWERED IN LIFE’S WARMTH the rest to suffer WE ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO MAKE A CHOICE count our blessings NO COVER showered in life’s warmth THE REST TO SUFFER we are fortunate enough to make a choice ILL BE A VOICE - cast out. forsaken. desperate. ill fated. everyday the value of life spreads thinner. but in this chaos I’ll be a hopebringer. - their trials are mine I stand for every single walk of life I’LL FIGHT I’ll fight for both human and non human rights because I know that things are much brighter on the other side.
