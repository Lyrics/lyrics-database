you’re fed up it never shuts up you’re seeing red once again you’ve had more than enough patients wearing thin your thoughts all turn to a blur your head and your heart turn to lightning and thunder all you want is five minutes of peace so you raise your fist and let loose the beast - what goes around what goes around what goes around goes around and around what goes around what goes around what goes around goes around and around and around - we are your children raised with the back of a hand - i know that we’ve done wrong but we’re not stupid WE’VE LEARNED and we wont make the same mistakes THAT YOU DID
