I know you, because you’re just like me
Always questioning every single thing
Never giving up without a fight
Because for you, your resistance is a way of life

Young and angry, with every right to be
Bent but not broken, hanging on by a thread
Looked past by most, looked down on by all.
We don’t need them, it’s forever us against them all
Forever us against them all

Go!

A fire burns inside you, fueled by everything that
You’ve ever been through
Every battle you fight goes uphill
But nothing can ever break your iron will

Young and angry, with every right to be
Bent but not broken, hanging on by a thread
Looked past by most, looked down on by all
We don’t need them, it’s forever us against them all
Forever us against them all

We don’t need them
