We still believe

I’m sick and tired of all this giving up,
All I hear is talk, and I’ve had enough.
Single minded, overwhelmingly one sided.
Refusing humanity, does not award morality.
Hope’s not dead so we’ll forever scream,
until it’s deafening.

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.

You opened the gate,
and what came rushing out
is far too powerful for you to hold down.
If there’s a better way, someone please tell me now,
but there’s not, this is what

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.

From here on out, I will live
deliberately!
I can’t sit back, to watch the world die,
I must fight back!
I’ll pay the price, there’s more to this,
not just me!

We still believe

We are the ones, who stay awake,
while the world sleeps.
Because we still believe.
We are the ones, who will achieve,
what the world dreams.
Because we still believe.
