Day in and day out
Shit on and kicked in
The world’s garbage you left sifting
Mind like a wrath flame and flood
Done talking, no one’s listening

They pushed me, they pushed me
I’ll rip this place at the seams
They did this, not me
Inflicted with this disease
I’m screaming, God help me
I scream as loud as I can
This is another life
Built upon the sand

You’ve hit bottom and you’re still sinking
So small and you’re still shrinking
What can you do
You’ve gone from alone to completely see through

Let’s all watch while the hammer falls

They pushed me, they pushed me
I’ll rip this place at the seams
They did this, not me
Inflicted with this disease
I’m screaming, God help me
I scream as loud as I can
This is another life
Built upon the sand

I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
I understand you
