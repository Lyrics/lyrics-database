Take this emptiness
And exorcise this wasteland

Take this emptiness
And exorcise this wasteland

Take this emptiness
Exorcise this wasteland

I’m not trying to live
I’m not a broken man
I’m burning bright
But unseen

I can’t be ...
... bleeding
...
...
...
... vacant lot
...
I can’t get anymore
...
...
...
My parasitic sense of self
Your weapon
