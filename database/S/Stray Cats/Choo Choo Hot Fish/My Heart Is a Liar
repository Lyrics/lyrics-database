Mmm…

Sitting by myself, looking out a broken window
And out on the street crowds of people passing by
But how are they to know I’m feeling so alone
I feel like I could break down and cry

Now I know how broken hearts must feel

But my heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it’s true
The flames keep on burning, burning so high
Never gonna die — why?

Sitting all alone, feeling sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kind of fool I’ve been
But how was I to know I have to let you go?
The only way to make it alright

Now you’ve lit the flame again

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it’s true
The flame keeps on burning, burning so high
It’s never gonna die — why?

Sometimes I think I pass you by
But it’s just love blinding my eyes

Sitting all alone, feeling sorry for myself
I catch my reflection and I see the kind of fool I’ve been
But how was I to know I had to let you go?
The only way to make it alright

Now you’ve lit the flame again!

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it’s true
The flame keeps burning, burning so high
Never gonna die — no-oh-oh!

My heart is a liar for you
My heart is a liar, it’s true
The flame keeps burning, burning so high
Never gonna die — why?
