He’s got a thing about you
Yeah, well, take it from someone who knows
He tries to track you down
And when he finds you, girl, he’s gonna do you wrong

He knows the way you move, the way you smile
He feels the way I do about you

He’s got a thing about you
Oh, take it from me
He just can’t live without you
He’s got a thing about you

I wanna set you free
But I think there’s a fire still burning
That’s the trouble with you
You’re always getting burned, but it never scars

He knows the way you move, the way you smile
He feels the way I do about you

He’s got a thing about you
Oh, take it from me
He just can’t live without you
Oh, he’s got a thing about you!

You wanna do what’s right
Yeah, well, that’s what you tell all your friends
Who can you trust, who can you run to?
Well, baby, you don’t even know what’s right for you

I know the way you move, the way you smile
I feel the way he does about you

I’ve got a thing about you
Oh, take it from me
I just can’t live without you
Oh, I got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
Oh, take it from me
I just can’t live without you
Oh, I got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
I’ve got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
Yea, I’ve got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
I’ve got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
Oh, I’ve got a thing about you

(I’ve got a thing about you)
