Well, trouble was on the horizon
The sky was cloudy and gray
Hurricane winds were a-blowing
And she was as cold as that day

Well, her eyes were as black as the dark stormy night
The first time I touched her, I trembled in fright
I found myself running for cover
But I couldn’t make it in time

I was struck by lightning twice
Struck by lightning twice
I don’t take nobody’s advice
I was struck by lightning twice
When the rain starts a-coming
You’d better start running
Struck by lightning twice!

Blinded by love like a blizzard
I couldn’t see nothing but you
My heart, it was pounding like thunder
Oh baby, can’t you hear it too?

Well, you left me for dead
Washed up on the shore
I didn’t learn once
So I came back for more
I kept you so safe and so warm
And you threw me out in the raging storm

Struck by lightning twice
Struck by lightning twice
I don’t take nobody’s advice
Baby!
I was struck by lightning twice
When the rain starts a-coming
Better start running
Struck by lightning twice!

Aaah!

Lord!
I was struck by lightning twice
I was struck by lightning twice
I don’t take nobody’s advice
I was struck by lightning twice
When the rain starts a-coming
You’d better start running
Struck by lightning twice!

Spinning around like a tornado
My head way up in the sky
I felt the earth shaking beneath me
I felt like I wanted to die

Well, then out of the fog and out of the night
There in the mist, in a rainbow of light
The chances are one in a million
That lightning could ever strike twice

Struck by lightning twice
I was struck by lightning twice
I don’t take nobody’s advice
Baby!
Struck by lightning twice
When the rain starts a-coming
You’d better start running
Struck by lightning, struck by lightning
Struck by lightning twice!
