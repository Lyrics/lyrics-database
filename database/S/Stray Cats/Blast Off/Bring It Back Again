(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Wide-open highway and the sun going down
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
I grab my guitar and pick out a song
You wear that pretty dress, we never could go wrong
We had no money but never seem to care
Our love took us everywhere

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around in a rag top ride
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
But now I got no one by my side
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Though I never share my memories
No one by my side to comfort me
I need your little hand to hold in mine
Got to hold you all the time

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

Is it any wonder, why I love you so?
Oh you were my first love
When your arms met mine
You just stole my heart for all time

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

I cruise around with the radio on
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Wide open highway with the sun going down
Make me feel alright
Make me feel alright
Though I know I’m the only one to blame
I’ve had enough of this sorrow and pain
I know that deep down you still feel the same
Bring me your love back again

Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

Come on, bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

Come on, bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)

Yeah, bring it back again
(Bring it back, bring it back, bring it back again)
Oh, bring it back again…
