Child of burning time
Child of burning time

My only consolation is a lie
The apex of my consequence is dying here tonight
Winter hasn’t ended and it always looks like rain
I can’t remember anything (anything)

Inside the absolution, we succumb
And appetites are bittersweet; I think I’m going numb
A chance to give up avarice has marked my one regret
The child of burning time is gone
He hasn’t come back yet…

Before I tell my story, please consider who I am
I missed my window years ago; I’m doing all I can
A tragedy is commonplace, but in the end, they go away
My skin is still the only stain I’m left to wear in shame

I cut my name into my heart
I’ll tear it all apart
I beg you

Burn me away
I won’t become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won’t give up tomorrow just to lose it all today

I burn away

My isolation is my course
The effect it has on life itself is a cancer on its source
I rue the moments spent between the fetish and the flame
Until this war is over, I won’t ever lose my rage

I cut my name into my soul
I guess I’ll never know
I beg you

Burn me away
I won’t become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won’t give up tomorrow just to lose it all today
Burn me away
I won’t become your hero just to fight the life I save
Burn me away
I won’t give up tomorrow just to lose it all, lose it all today
