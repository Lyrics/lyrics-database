Welcome out

Mother Nature is a coward (Mother Nature is a whore)
No more presence, no more power (I pray for death by the hour)
Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are)
My artifice won’t recognize me (You won’t find me) anymore

Posttraumatic war machines
The pessimists still won’t believe
Throw away my past mistakes
It’s all I can to feel

Let my weapons be your children
Let my armies be your damned
Try to suffer on in silence
Try to stop me if you can

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Someday, one day, we’ll live our lives again

My ghosts have found their way back home
I have every right to kill my own (I have every right to kill my own)
I am something now that never could exist
My anguish conquers all; pay the price and watch me fall
My only key is broken—my broken key is only… Me

Pneumatic destroyer
Pathetic seducer
Distortion sufficient
Someday, one day, we’ll live our lives again

You utter waste of tired flesh
It doesn’t matter if you can’t progress
Even now, they still create me
Give me your ignorance; irritate me

I am made of the same debris
You want it all, but you didn’t want me
Hypocrite with no real use
I’m alive; what’s your excuse?

We’ll live our lives again
