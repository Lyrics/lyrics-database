Contrite, commercial, arrogance, leprosy
Consume the bitch, the fecker—mindless, like a child
For pity’s sake—I’ve had all that I can take
We try—but in the end, we’ll see
There are no more codes
Only who is shit and who’s still free

I was gonna change the world
With honor and aggression
No one listened; no one cared
All they saw was misdirection

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

I don’t want you anymore
I don’t want you anymore
I don’t need you anymore
I don’t need you anymore

Fingerprint of God; your new religions covet
This vessel wasn’t built to last
But I will live forever; you’ll never have to say, "Surrender"
Because you’re so part of it

My total honesty has no place for tomorrow
Guilty pleasures give me pain
Tell my people I can’t follow

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

You’ll never censor me; you’d better cherish me
My reason has a voice; freedom’s gone, but we’ll always have a choice
My present future tense, it doesn’t make much sense
I’m coming after you—fuck you all; I’m the only point of view

Violence and dollar signs; another processed piece of shit
You hide your fault in diamonds and give away the only cost
You can’t delay the inevitable
Lost—don’t understand the incredible path
I’m losing ground, but I won’t care when I go down

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

(Go ahead and disagree)
I’m giving up again

I’m giving up again
I’m giving up again
