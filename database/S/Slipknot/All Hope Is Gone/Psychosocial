Yeah

I did my time and I want out
So effusive—fade—it doesn’t cut
The soul is not so vibrant
The reckoning, the sickening
Packaging subversion
Pseudo-sacrosanct perversion

Go drill your deserts, go dig your graves
Then fill your mouth with all the money you will save
Sinking in, getting smaller again
I’m done; it has begun
I’m not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial

Oh, there are cracks in the road we laid
But when the temple fell
The secrets have gone mad
This is nothing new, but when we killed it all
The hate was all we had

Who needs another mess?
We could start over
Just look me in the eyes and say I’m wrong
Now there’s only emptiness
But I’m missing something
I think we’re done
I’m not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

Psychosocial
Psychosocial
Psychosocial
Psychosocial
Psychosocial
Psychosocial

The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead

Fake antifascist lie (psychosocial)
I tried to tell you, but (psychosocial)
Your Purple Hearts are giving out (psychosocial)
Can’t stop a killing idea (psychosocial)
If it’s hunting season (psychosocial)
Is this what you want? (psychosocial)
I’m not the only one

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

And the rain will kill us all
We throw ourselves against the wall
But no one else can see
The preservation of the martyr in me

The limits of the dead
The limits of the dead
