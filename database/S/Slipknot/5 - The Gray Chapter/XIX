This song is not for the living
This song is for the dead

With my face against the floor
I can’t see who knocked me out of the way
I don’t want to get back up
But I have to, so it might as well be today

Nothing appeals to me, no one feels like me
I’m too busy being calm to disappear
I’m in no shape to be alone
Contrary to the shit that you might hear

So walk with me, walk with me
Don’t let the symbolism kill your heart
Walk with me, walk with me
Just like we should have done right from the start
Walk with me, walk with me
Don’t let this fucking world tear you apart
