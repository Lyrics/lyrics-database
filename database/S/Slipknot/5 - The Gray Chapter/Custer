"I have this one: dut-dut dat, dut-dut dat, dut-dut dat dat dat"
"Dut-dut dat dut-dut dat dut-dut dat dat dat"

Yeah
Yeah

Rise
Half alive and stark-raving free and maligned
For encroaching on the purpose of this commercial-free interruption
Due to the prolific nature of this statement
Listener aggression is advised

It’s strange, whenever I see a gun
I think about just how petty you are
And it blows my fucking mind
It blows my fucking mind

These days, I never seem to get enough
I’m tired of this shit- I want to go home
Don’t waste my fucking time
Don’t waste my fucking time

Because anything exceptional gets crushed by common people
With jealousy and ignorance and all their common evils
This planet isn’t special, collections made of clay
I’m waiting for the punishment I know is on my way

So cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It’s second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

Somewhere on a toilet wall, I read the words
"You form a line to formalize the former lies."
And I finally saw the truth
Something so profound and it was sitting there
Surrounded by the garbage and the stains
Another victim of the refuse

Now I’ve been saying this for years but you don’t comprehend it
I fight hell and I fight fear because I understand it
Androgyny and insults- you try so hard to be difficult
You want to win the war? Know what you’re fighting for

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Irreverence is my disease
It’s second hand but you know me
The son of a bitch is on his knees
The last man standing gets no pity

With angel eyes and demon seeds
You’re missing what you really need
When all is said and done, you see
The last man standing gets no pity

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up

Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
Cut/cut/cut me up and fuck/fuck/fuck me up
