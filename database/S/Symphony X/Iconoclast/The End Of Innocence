Bite your tongue -
The blackened sun will curse the moon
Skies of Fire - nothing’s worth a damn

Calculate - anticipate your every move
Beware - the ruthless hearts of man

Feel my pain - My words are in vain
I believe it’s the End of Innocence
Don’t look away - Hear what I say
I believe it’s the End of Innocence

Cut and splice, a fierce device -
- Degenerate -
Sons of Light - synthetic Gods of Man

Crushed beneath the Dragon Beast - breathing hate
Your blood, your blood is on their hands

Feel my pain - My words are in vain
I believe it’s the End of Innocence
Don’t look away - Oh, Hear what I say
I believe it’s the End of Innocence

The World is dying
The precious sands of time are running out
We are the fallen
Made obsolete - methodically phased out
… feel my pain

Feel my pain - My words are in vain
I believe it’s the End of Innocence
Don’t look away - Hear what I say
I believe it’s the End of Innocence
