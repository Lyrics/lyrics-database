Tap the vein - inject my brain
And let the poison flow
Torn apart - you’re ripping out my heart
It’s painless, let it go

Hit the switch - you son of a bitch
I’m devoured, broke in two
You take control and resurrect my soul
Becoming something new…

What’s done is done - I’m dead inside
I’m what you’ve all become - mindless and mesmerized

Dehumanized
I’m dehumanized
Don’t you realize - I’m Dehumanized
Oh, and Victimized
You can’t break me,
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Ripped to shreds - the venom spreads
Release the system plague
Shed your skin - electrified within
Complete the final stage

I will break my shell and unleash Hell
There’s nothing you can do
Just a cut above - this sacred New Blood
Becoming something new…

What’s done is done - I’m dead inside
I’m what you’ve all become - mindless and mesmerized

Dehumanized
I’m Dehumanized
Don’t you realize - I’m Dehumanized
Oh, and Victimized
You can’t break me,
You unmake me - Dehumanized

Is this life worth the question why?
Or is this life just a lie?
’Cause my eyes are cold and numb,
And I don’t know what the hell I’ve become…

Dehumanized
I’m Dehumanized
Don’t you realize - We’re all dehumanized
Enslaved and Victimized
You can’t break us,
No, you can’t unmake us
We have all become - Dehumanized
