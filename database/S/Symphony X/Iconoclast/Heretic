The human infection
Soaring on winds of woe and pestilence
Remove imperfection -
Parasites with lives of little consequence.

Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe,
On your knees…

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit’s the kingdom you devise

The flesh breeds corruption -
Irradicate the insect prey, exterminate
Crawl with the Leeches - you cry
Shattered to pieces - you die
Here I stand - god of man - the Perfect Beast

Even though we know the sky is falling
Still we choose not to believe
On your knees…

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls, brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit’s the kingdom you devise

Watch me burn - Live and learn
As the night surrounds me
No escape, no where to hide

Feel the sting of severing
Become one with Darkness
No escape, I’m dead inside

Heretic - devil in disguise
Never quit - tearing down the walls,
Brick by brick
Feeding on the lies - Heretic
Counterfeit’s the kingdom you devise
