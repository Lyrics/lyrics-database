Scorn the omen - architects of deceit
Pulverized within the jaws of defeat
Our ruin engineered, we’ve reached the gates of fear

Forging vengeance in the city of doom
Ripping death from sin’s unholy womb
The riders on the storm, cursed the day they’re born
We were warned…

Strike them down - strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war

Treads of iron crush the skulls of the damned
Stench of burning flesh covers the land
Rising from the screams - a godless war machine

Execution - fire scorches the sky
Crimson horseman runs with genocide
As the seas turns red, we raise the living dead
Or so it’s said…

Strike them down - strike with power
Kill them all from shore to shore
We destroy - we devour
We command the vicious dogs of war

Bow your heads and abandon hope
We’re the gods of pain
Raise your hands if you’ll join with us
And let the madness reign

Forsaken and forgotten
Condemned - hopeless and alone
The sickened and the rotten
Infect everything you’ve ever known

War hammer of disaster
Crushing every living head
Surrender to the masters
You’re brainwashed electric living dead

There’s no escaping
The more I learn, the less I know
I must be crazy
I’m giving in, I’m letting go

If all the world’s a stage,
It’s just a masquerade of crazies
Hit the lights and start the show…

Bow your heads and abandon hope
We’re the gods of pain
Raise your hands if you’ll join with us
And let the madness reign
