Have you lost all your senses?
Why did you have to go tempting fate?
Blinded by your ambitions
Why can’t you see the chaos you create?

Oh - have we gone too far, too fast?

My dying eyes - scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the Lies - shine so bright
All the souls of the world Light up the Night

You’re a slave to desire
For lust of profit you consume my soul
Do you think you can make it stop?
Oh no - it’s too late to turn, you’ve lost control

Oh - have we gone too far too fast?

My dying eyes - scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the Lies - shine so bright
All the souls of the world Light up the Night

Pushing the boundaries - reinvent a new reality
Changing Evolution - ignoring the past
As we realize our destructive destiny…

My dying eyes - scream with pain
All my hopes and my dreams drown in flames
And all the Lies - shine so bright
All the souls of the world Light up the Night
