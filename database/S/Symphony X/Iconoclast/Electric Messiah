You liberate me, separate and set me free
You release my spirit to the wind
For evermore your name will soar inside of me
Let the reign of steel begin

Oh, how the prophets of the people were so blind
As one by one, all the kingdoms fall in line

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul on fire

All will believe, you won’t deceive in any way
Endless empty minds at you command

I’ll never fail, I’ll drive the nail in all the way
Right into you heart with dying hands

Oh, how the prophets of the people were so blind
As one by one, all the kingdoms fall in line

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul on fire

Hail the Night - the Bringer of Light
My Electric Messiah
Come and be transformed - unmade and reborn
Set your soul on fire
