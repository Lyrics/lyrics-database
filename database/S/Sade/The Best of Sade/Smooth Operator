He’s laughing with another girl
And playing with another heart
Placing high stakes, making hearts ache
He’s loved in seven languages
Diamond nights and ruby lights
High in the sky
Heaven help him when he falls

Diamond life lover boy
He moves in space with minimum waste and maximum joy
City lights, business nights
When you require streetcar, desire for higher heights
No place for beginners or sensitive hearts
The sentiment is left to chance
No place to be ending but somewhere to start

No need to ask, he’s a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago, Western male
Across The North, and south to Key Largo, love for sale

Face-to-face, each classic case
We shadow box and double-cross
Yet need that chase
A license to love, insurance to hold
Melt all your memories and change into gold
His eyes are like angels, but his heart is cold

No need to ask, he’s a smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Coast-to-coast, L.A. to Chicago, Western male
Across The North, and south to Key Largo, love for sale

Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator

Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
Smooth operator
