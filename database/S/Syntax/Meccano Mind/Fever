I can’t be your daddy
You’ve already had me
I will not be your backbone
You see, I’m riding my style, on my own

It’s about love
It’s about soft
Give me whores who never sleep
Give me fever running deep

You see, I’m looking for less cohesion
I will not see your reason
Romance doesn’t suit me
But you dance to amuse me

It’s about love
It’s about soft
Give me whores who never sleep
Give me fever running deep

You try to approach me
But crawling doesn’t please me
I cannot feel elation
I got to feel a love sensation

It’s about love, love and strange times
It’s about soft, soft and chilling rhymes
Give me whores who never sleep
Give me fever running deep

Give me love
Give me soft babe
Come on give me whores
Come give me fever
