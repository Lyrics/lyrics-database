It’s made up of lonely moments
There was always a moment there when I knew
You always gave instalments
Always knew you concentrated and grew

And I believe in reinvention
Do you believe that life is holding a clue?
Take away all the lonely moments
Give me full communication with you

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Do you believe in reinvention?
Do you believe that life is holding a clue?
Any way to face the silence
Any way to face the pain that kills you

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride (give up on your pride)

Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride (give up on your pride)

Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride (give up on your pride)

Give up on your pride, the moment’s gone
I said give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen a bad dream, that you were gone
I got bitten on the soul, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment’s gone
I said give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen a bad dream, you were gone
You’re bitter and cold, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment’s gone
I said give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen a bad dream, you were gone
You’re bitter and cold, my blood will run

Give up on your pride, the moment’s gone
I said give up on your smile, life is long
So I seen a bad dream, you were gone
You’re bitter and cold, my blood will run

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride

Your smile shine a little light
Alright
Don’t hide, shine a little light
Give up on your pride
