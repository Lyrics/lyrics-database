This is my Destiny, only child
Come on and rescue me, ’cos I’m wild
This is my selection when I’m sure
Not looking for deception like before

Beautiful creation I adore
This sensation never felt before

How can I change the path that I’m on?
This is my Destiny
This is my life, my own right or wrong
Bring it on back to me
How can I say what it is that I want?
Wisdom, speak to me
Life your sweet then the moment is gone

This is my Destiny

This is my intention, hear me now
Don’t need correction, please me how
Breaking out the institution, crazy law
Ain't no complication, live for more

This is my Destiny, only child
Come on and rescue me ’cos I’m wild

How can I change the path that I’m on?
This is my Destiny
This is my life, my own right or wrong
Bring it on back to me
How can I say what it is that I want?
Wisdom, speak to me
Life your sweet then the moment is gone

This is my Destiny

This is my Destiny

Only child, only child
Come on and rescue me, ’cos I’m wild
