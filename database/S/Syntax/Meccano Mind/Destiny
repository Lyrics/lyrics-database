This is my Destiny
Only child
Come on and rescue me
’Cos I’m wild

This is my selection
When I’m sure
Not looking for deception
Like before

Beautiful creation
I adore
This sensation
Never felt before

How can I change the path that I’m on?
This is my Destiny
This is my life, my own right or wrong
Bring it on back to me
How can I say what it is that I want?
Wisdom, speak to me
Life your sweet, then the moment is gone

This is my Destiny…

This is my intention
Hear me now
Don’t need correction
Please me how

Breaking out the institution
Crazy law
Ain't no complication
Live for more

This is my Destiny
Only child
Come on and rescue me
’Cos I’m wild

How can I change the path that I’m on?
This is my Destiny
This is my life, my own right or wrong
Bring it on back to me
How can I say what it is that I want?
Wisdom, speak to me
Life your sweet, then the moment is gone

This is my Destiny…

This is my Destiny…

Only child
Only child
Come on and rescue me
’Cos I’m wild
