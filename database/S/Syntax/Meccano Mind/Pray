Now you see you’re breaking up again
Now you see you’re slowly going insane
You don’t even know your face or name
Stand up now, we’ve got to break this chain

Now do you see the feeling in your eyes?
Do you know the things that make you cry?
There are things that money just won’t buy
Wake up now, you got to trust and try

No I don’t advocate God
And you don’t seem to find love
Don’t waste time praying
Get on with finding

Just as you began to find your way
I found you there with just bad words to say
Get out of here, you’re just a waste of space
You’re on your own, it’s you and your disgrace

No I don’t advocate God
And you don’t seem to find love
Don’t waste time praying
Get on with finding

It’s been a long time coming
But now you’ve found some loving
Don’t throw it all away now
Don’t get on your knees and pray now

No I don’t advocate God
And you don’t seem to find love
Don’t waste time praying
Get on with finding
