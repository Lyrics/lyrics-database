I want to be the one, the only one
’Cause there’s nothing we can do together, ye-ye
I doubt that you can ...
And that puts everything on you
And that could never
I said forever (ye-ye)

I don’t know what else could be
But when it all comes back to me
You are nowhere to be found
Until I’m lying on the ground, now
I wonder if I ever try to get it right
’Cause there’s nothing that I can seem to even get back midnight

I’m going out of mind
I’m going out of mind
I’m going out of mind
I’m going out of mind

You want to bring me down
But that ain’t nothing new
Is that the best that you can do now?
You want to bring me down
I’ve had enough of you
Is that the best that you can do now?

I'll never be ... only ...
The only place for me to go is taken, ye-ye
I don’t think you could know me ... I will
And if you think you do, you are mistaken
And I mean mistaken (ye-ye)

I want to get as far away from you
As I can hardly seem to do
And then I turn around to see
That you are standing next to me
I wonder if you ever get it through your head
That I won't be the only one who’s laughing when you’re dead, now

I’m going out of my mind
I’m going out of my mind
I’m going out of my mind
I’m going out of my mind

You want to bring me down
But that ain’t nothing new
Is that the best that you can do now?
You want to bring me down
I’ve had enough of you
Is that the best that you can do now for me?

(’Cause I can barely see, ye-ye-ye-ye)

You want to bring me down — is that the best that you can do?
You want to bring me down — is that the best that you can do?
You want to bring me down — is that the best that you can do?
You want to bring me down — is that the best that you can do?

You want to bring me down
But that ain’t nothing new
Is that the best that you can do now?
You want to bring me down
I’ve had enough of you
Is that the best that you can do now for me?
