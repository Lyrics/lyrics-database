When I’m down beside you
I try not to worry ’bout all the things I do
When I’m by myself now, when I look inside you
I just can’t see the way things used to be

Why do I think about, why do I think about
All the things that you can’t do for me?

I don’t believe in my responsibility
I don’t believe that anything you say is true now
I don’t believe in any kind of charity
I don’t believe in you, no, I dont believe in you

When I think about you
I make believe that nothin’ bad has ever happened between you and me
When I listen to you
I want to hear all the things you never seem to say

Why do I think about, why do I think about
All the things that you can’t do for me?

I don’t believe in my responsibility
I don’t believe that anything you say is true now
I don’t believe in any kind of charity
I don’t believe in you, oh no, I don’t believe in you

When I turn around
I’m still surprised that I don’t see you right behind me anymore
But when I think I need you
I just remember all the times that you weren’t there

Why do I think about, why do I think about
All the things that you can’t do now?
Why do I think about, why do I think about
All the things that you can’t do for me?

I don’t believe in my responsibility
I don’t believe that anything you say is true now
I don’t believe in any kind of charity
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you now

I don’t believe in my responsibility
I don’t believe that anything you say is true now
I don’t believe in any kind of charity
I don’t believe in you, I don’t believe in you
