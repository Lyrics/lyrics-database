The devil’s eating me inside
I feel like I died
Nothing is as nothing seems
Makes me wanna scream
I don’t know how I’ll make it through this night
I’ll never be alright
I don’t know what you want me to do
It ain’t nothing new

I don’t want to cause you pain
But I’m feeling quite insane
And I’ve got nowhere to go
Baby, don’t you know now?
Way down deep inside of me
Is the way things got to be
I just got to let you know
I got to let you know…

I don’t think that I can stand no more
Of what I left you for
I let my instincts lead the way
There ain’t no better way
I know that nothing stays the same
But who else can I blame, who else can I blame?
I don’t know what you want me to be
It’s nothing I can see

I don’t want to cause you pain
But I’m feeling quite insane
And I’ve got nowhere to go
But don’t you know now?
Way down deep inside of me
Is the way things got to be
I just got to let you know
I got to let you know now

I don’t want to cause you pain
But I’m feeling quite insane
And I’ve got nowhere to go
Baby, don’t you know now?
Way down deep inside of me
Is the way things got to be
I just got to let you know
I got to let you know now
