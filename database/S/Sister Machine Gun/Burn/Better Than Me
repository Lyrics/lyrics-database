Burning is my condition, baby now
Burning with everything that I see
Burning is my solution, baby now
I know you think that you’re better than me

(I know you think that you’re better than me)

I can barely feel like anything
I can barely see
I can walk over broken glass
That cuts like razor through my fantasies
I can be whatever I want to
It doesn’t matter to me
I sit and stare at this gun pointed at my head
And think about all the posibilities

Burning is my condition, baby now
Burning with everything that I see
Burning is my solution, baby now
I know you think that you’re better than me

I never needed to feel any self-control
I never had to believe
In anything but my desire
To never be what you tell me to be
I can die whenever I want to
It doesn’t matter to me
Take the easy way out
To end all of my responsibilities

Burning is my condition, baby now
Burning with everything that I see
Burning is my solution, baby now
I know you think that you’re better than me

(I’m a loser, and I can barely see me)
(I know you think that you’re better than me)
(I’m a loser, and I can barely see me)
(I know you think that you’re better than me)
(I’m a loser, and I can barely see me)
(I know you think that you’re better than me)
(I’m a loser, and I can barely see me)
(I know you think that you’re better than me)

Burning is my condition, baby now
Burning with everything that I see
Burning is my solution, baby now
I know you think that you’re better than me
