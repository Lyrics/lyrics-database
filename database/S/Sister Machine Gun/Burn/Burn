I look at you and then I see your fire
And I’m thinking about desire
Yes, I’m thinking about desire

Telling me the things that you try to hide
And I’m burning up inside
Oh, how I’m burning up inside

When I think about the first time that I saw your face
I never felt this way
Oh Lord, I never felt this way

And now I’m thinking that you feel the same
And if there’s anyway
I’ll get down on my knees and pray

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

What kind of fool am I
To want your body next to mine?
I want your body next to mine

I need you any time
And I’m breaking down inside
Oh Lord, I’m breaking down inside

You cover me with all your hopeless little fantasies
I never had before
No, I never had before

And now I’m living in my own reality
’Cause of the things you did to me
Oh, the things you did to me

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same

You’re like a burning flame
And I’ll never be the same
No, I’ll never be the same
