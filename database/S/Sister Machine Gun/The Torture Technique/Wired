I know you’re goin’ nowhere
But I follow where you lead
It’s a good thing you got nothing
’Cause it’s nothing that I need
Don’t know why I bother
When I know what I will find
I think I’m going crazy
But it’s only in my mind, it’s in my mind

Do I do I know I can be
One soul, one body, one mind
Flesh to flesh is me
And I leave all the rest behind
Infuse my body, I’ll be one body, one Christ divine
One drug is left to me
And I’m wired, ain’t afraid of God (ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God)

I know I’m in denial
But it happens all the time
And running with the devil
Never used to be a crime
I don’t want your sympathy
You never were, never were too kind
I’d like to think I used you
But it’s only in my mind

Do I do I know I can be
One soul, one body, one mind
Flesh to flesh is me
And I leave all the rest behind
Infuse my body I’ll be one body, one Christ divine
One drug is left to me
And I’m wired, ain’t afraid of God (ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God)

Do I do I know I can be
One soul, one body, one mind
Flesh to flesh is me
And I leave all the rest behind
Infuse my body, I’ll be one body, one Christ divine
One drug is left to me
And I’m wired, ain’t afraid of God (ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God)

(Denial never took the blame
of where I am today
besides dragging me to the point
where ignorance will lead the way
heaven is an empty dream
hell is in my brain
’cause I’m too busy finding out
the dues I have to pay)

Do I do I know I can be
One soul, one body, one mind
Flesh to flesh is me
And I leave all the rest behind
Infuse my body I’ll be one body, one Christ divine
One drug is left to me
And I’m wired, ain’t afraid of God (ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God, ain’t afraid of God)
