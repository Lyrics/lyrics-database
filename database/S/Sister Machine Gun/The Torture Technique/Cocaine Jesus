Lying in a grave that I dug myself
Wishing that my life belonged to somebody else
Know I’m gonna live, but I think I might die
Crushed by the weight of my personal hell
I’m so fucked up I don’t know my own name
Think I’d learn by now that it’s always the same
I know that I’m gonna die, that I’m gonna die someday
But it’s so goddamn good when it’s been in my brain

Cocaine Jesus
Cocaine Jesus

Feel like heaven and I’m feeling so good
And I said I wasn’t gonna when I knew that I would
Gonna kick it soon, gonna be the last time
I’d quit lying to myself if I thought that I could
I never would have started if I saw myself now
Now I want to stop it, but I just don’t know how
I’ve done worshipped at the idol and I want to get out
But Cocaine Jesus, he would never allow

Cocaine Jesus
Cocaine Jesus
Cocaine Jesus
Cocaine Jesus
