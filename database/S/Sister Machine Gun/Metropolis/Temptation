Whatever happened to the life I had in your eyes?
I guess I died and I started to believe your lies
Like the voice that I heard in the night
If you think I’m crazy then you’re goddamned right

I need to get out of this mess you put me in
And I think is where I’d like to begin
Well I, I really doubt that you think that I would be fine
Well, c’mon baby, now it’s temptation time

You fucked up, it’s easy to see
But I don’t know what that has to do with me
’Cause I’m knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I’m crazy, then you’re goddamned right

You didn’t happen to save my soul
As it went out the door with the rest of my goals
Well, I just decided that I might like it back
And I’m as serious as a goddamned heart attack

Well, now baby, I tried to make it plain
When I said I was getting tired of these stupid little games
Well, it’s pretty simple, if you try to keep in mind
Well now baby, it’s temptation time

You fucked up, it’s easy to see
But I don’t know what that has to do with me
’Cause I’m knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I’m crazy, then you’re goddamned right

You fucked up, it’s easy to see
But I don’t know what that has to do with me
’Cause I’m knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I’m crazy, then you’re goddamned right

I didn’t mean to cause you any grief
But the things that you do to me go way beyond belief
Well, I never thought that I’d feel like I was dead
But your voice is like a bullet in my goddamn head

And I need to feel wanted, I guess anybody would
But you treat me like a child and that just ain’t any good
Well, I just want to have the things that I think are mine
C’mon baby, it’s temptation time

You fucked up, it’s easy to see
But I don’t know what that has to do with me
’Cause I’m knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I’m crazy, then you’re goddamned right

You fucked up, it’s easy to see
But I don’t know what that has to do with me
’Cause I’m knocked down and ready to fight
If you think I’m crazy, then you’re goddamned right
