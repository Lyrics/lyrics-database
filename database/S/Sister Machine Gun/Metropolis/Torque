I’m riding with the top down, everything’s fine
There ain’t nothing goin’ on inside my mind
’Cuz I’m trying not to think enough about me
But I’m gonna join the devil in the deep blue sea
And my blood’s in overdrive, never can tell
But the fact of the matter is I know quite well
Livin’ ain’t livin’ in a small amount
So take it from me, every little bit counts

Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts

If I run away from every little thing I fear
I know I’ve got to get the hell out of here
But it’s time to get away from the things I don’t like
If there ain’t something better coming down the pike
Never had a hard time happen this bad
And I never met nothing that could make me mad
But then livin’ ain’t livin’ in a small amount
So take it from me, every little bit counts

Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts

(I hate to be the one)
Every little bit counts
(To bring you down like this)
Every little bit counts
(I hate to be the one)
Every little bit counts
(To bring you down like this)
Every little bit counts

Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts

I never saw anything happen that fast
Now I ain’t very well and I’m makin’ this last
But I know that everything I do is wrong
And I’m trying to fit where I don’t belong
My brain’s in overdrive, never can tell
But the fact of the matter is I know quite well
Livin’ ain’t livin’ in a small amount
So take it from me, every little bit counts

Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts
Every little bit counts

(I hate to be the one)
Every little bit counts
(To bring you down like this)
Every little bit counts
(I hate to be the one)
Every little bit counts
(To bring you down like this)
Every little bit counts
