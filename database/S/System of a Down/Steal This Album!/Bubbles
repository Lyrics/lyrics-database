Fish that don’t drown
Life in a bubble jungle
I wouldn’t frown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was in there for you
Now leaving town
Life in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We’re the power struck
Believing, then kneeling
Appeasing
The power struggle

We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle

Wearing the crown
Life in a bubble jungle
Chasing a clown
Not short another chuckle
Snake in the ground
But I was waiting for you
Now we have found
Life in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We’re the power struck
Believing, then kneeling
Appeasing
The power struggle

We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
Left with no arms
In the power struggle
Left with no arms
In the power struggle

May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you

May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you

May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you
May I remind you

Your life is in a bubble jungle

Seeing you believing
Us adhering
We’re the power struck
Believing, then kneeling
Appeasing
The power struggle

We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
We’re left with no arms
Right in the power struggle
Left with no arms
In the power struggle
Left with no arms
Right here in the power struggle
