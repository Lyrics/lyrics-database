The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves
The senses collect undeniable data
Of beta carotene and thetawaves
The unsettled mind is at times an ally
Leaving the senses to fend for themselves, then
The senses wanted the sky

All rise, eyes bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexities arms
Caressing our smiles inside

The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves
The people collect undeniable data
’Bout high pulse weapons and microwaves
The national debt is at times an ally
Leaving the people to fend for themselves, then
The people found out the lie

All rise, eyes bound
Now arise, heaven bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexities arms
Caressing our smiles inside

Waiting to get you high
Waiting to touch the sky

All rise, eyes bound
Now arise, heaven bound

Time feels like a midnight ride
Finality waits outside
Weeping in perplexities arms
Caressing our smiles in
