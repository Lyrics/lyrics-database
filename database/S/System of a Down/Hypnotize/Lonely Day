Such a lonely day, and it’s mine
The most loneliest day of my life
Such a lonely day should be banned
It’s a day that I can’t stand

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day shouldn’t exist
It’s a day that I’ll never miss
Such a lonely day, and it’s mine
The most loneliest day of my life

And if you go, I want to go with you
And if you die, I want to die with you
Take your hand and walk away

The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life
The most loneliest day of my life

Such a lonely day, and it’s mine
It’s a day that I’m glad I survived
