Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling overhead with no sight
While you are talking all detached, so tell us

Where you’re going to the bottom
Do you hear us? We are rotting
We’re going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one’s gonna save us now

Ceremonies have killed religions for they provide
The masked comforts to delusionals, they’re all in fright
The true believer’s head was bathed in sunlight
While you are walking all detached, so tell us

Where you’re going to the bottom
Do you hear us? We are rotting
We’re going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one’s gonna save us now
Not even God
No one saved us, no one’s gonna save us

Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect them to go when the bombs fall?
Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?

Superstition taking all of us for a ride
Mimes overtaken by the signs of the Right
The bombs are falling over our head with no sight
While you are talking all detached, detached, detached, detached, detached

We’re going down in a spiral to the ground
No one, no one’s gonna save us now!
No one saved us, no one saved us
No one saved us, no one’s gonna save us now

Where do you expect us to go when the bombs fall?
