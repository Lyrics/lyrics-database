Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah

Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah

Can you feel their haunting presence
Can you feel their haunting presence

Liar, killer, demon
Back to the River Aras

Someone’s blank stare deemed it warfare

Liar, killer, demon
Back to the River Aras

Freedom
Freedom
We’re free
We’re free

Can you hear the Holy Mountains

Liar, killer, demon
Back to the River Aras

Someone’s mouth said, "Paint them all red."

Liar, killer, demon
Back to the River Aras

Freedom
Freedom
We’re free
Free

They have all returned, resting on the mountain side
We have learned that you have no…
They have returned resting on the mountain side
We have learned that you have no…

Honor… murderer, sodomizer
Back to the River Aras

They have returned, resting on the mountain side
We have learned that you have no…

Honor… murderer, sodomizer
Back to the River Aras

Freedom
Freedom
We’re free
Free

Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah

Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah
Ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah
