Poisoning a drink
Bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link
Killing with a stink
Just your mother’s
Ho

Bleeding in a sink
Poisoning a drink
Burning up
My sweet Clementine

Trampling a shrink
Bleeding in a sink
Hallelujah, wink
Getting on the brink
Just your mother’s
Ho

Hallelujah, wink
Murdering a shrink
Burning up

All my sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
It’s in the making, baby

My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
It’s in the making, baby

Killing with a stink
Bleeding in a sink
Poisoning a drink
Getting on the brink
Just your mother’s
Ho

Bleeding in a sink
Trampling a shrink
Burning up
My sweet Clementine

Poisoning a drink
Bleeding in a sink
Choking with a link
Killing with a stink
Just your mother’s
Ho

Poisoning a drink
Bleeding in a sink
Burning up

My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
It’s in the making, baby

My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
It’s in the making, baby

I saw her laugh
Then she said, "Go away"

I saw her laugh
Then she said, then she said
"Go away, away"

My sweet revenge
Will be yours for the taking
It’s in the making, baby

My sweet revenge
Will be yours it’s in the making
It’s in the taking, making, baking, taking, faking
Ho, my sweet Clementine
Ho

Shoulda been, coulda been
Woulda been, woulda been you
Shoulda been, coulda been
Woulda been, woulda been you
