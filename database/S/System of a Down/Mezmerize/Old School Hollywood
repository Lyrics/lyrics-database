Tony Danza cuts in line
(Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood)
Standing in the sun, I’m wasting my time
(Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood)

Me and Frankie Avalon

Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood

Hey man, don’t you touch my belt
(Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood)
Standing in the sun I’m about to melt
(Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood)

Me and Frankie Avalon

Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
Old school Hollywood, washed up Hollywood
