My cock is much bigger than yours!
My cock can walk right through the door!
With a feeling so pure!
It’s got you screaming back for more!

Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-

My shit stinks much better than yours!
My shit stinks right down through the floor!
With a feeling so pure!
It’s got you coming back for more!

Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-

Can’t you see that I love my cock?
Can’t you see that you love my cock?
Can’t you see that we love my cock?

We’re the regulators that deregulate
We’re the animators that de-animate
We’re the propagators of all genocide
Burning through the world’s resources
Then we turn and hide

We’re cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-

We’re the regulators that deregulate
We’re the animators that de-animate

We’re cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-
Cool, in denial
We’re the cruel regulators smoking cigaro, cigaro, cigar-

My cock is much bigger than yours!
My cock can walk right through the door!
With a feeling so pure!
It’s got you screaming back for more!
