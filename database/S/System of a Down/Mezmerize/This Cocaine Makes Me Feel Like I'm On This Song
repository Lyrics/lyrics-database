There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
There’s something wrong with me
I hope your stepson doesn’t eat the fish
When we’re crying for our next fix

There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
There’s something wrong with me
I hope your stepson doesn’t eat the fish
When we’re crying for our next fix

Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings

Gonorrhea, Gorgonzola
Gonorrhea, Gorgonzola
Single files of clean feedings

I can’t see your soul, soul through your eyes
The crying walls of sliding architecture
Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture
Upholstery loving men all dwelling in the wells
Kidnapped by the likes of pure conjecture

Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings

Gonorrhea, Gorgonzola
Gonorrhea, Gorgonzola
Single files of clean feedings

There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
Wrong with you and I
When we’re crying for our next fix

There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
Wrong with you and I
When we’re crying for our next fix

Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings
Killers never hurt feelings

Gonorrhea, Gorgonzola

Single files of clean feedings

There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
There’s something wrong with me
I hope your stepson doesn’t eat the fish
There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you

There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
There’s something wrong with me
I hope your stepson doesn’t eat the fish
There’s nothing wrong with me
There’s something wrong with you
Don’t eat the fish
