I should look on Helen’s face in hell
When I issue my last breath,
The stories they will tell

They’ll say men can be bad but so can women
Men won’t say that women swim in
Oceans of truth

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

Should’ve seen the look on Helen’s face as she fell,
But she succumbed to him and her soul she will sell
There is no reason that has a meaning
There is no reason that has a meaning

I should look on Helen’s face in hell

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

I should look on Helen’s face in hell

(we’re all guilty)
(dip our toes)
(but remain aloof)

(we’re all guilty)
(dip our toes)
(but remain aloof)

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise

In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
In your own, in your own, in your own time
You will realise
