The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you…
Strange what desire will make foolish people do…
And I never dreamed that I’d meet somebody like you…
And I never dreamed that I’d lose somebody like you…

No, I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
No, I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
With you…
With you…

What a wicked game to play…
To make me feel this way…
What a wicked thing to do…
To make me dream of you…
What a wicked thing to say
You never felt that way!
What a wicked thing to do
To make me dream of you!

And I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
No, I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
With you…
With you…

The world was on fire and no-one could save me but you…
Strange what desire will make foolish people do…
And I never dreamed that I’d need somebody like you…
And I never dreamed that I’d lose somebody like you…

No, I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
No, I…
Don’t wanna fall in love
No, I…
No, I…

Nobody
Loves, no-one
