I don’t know how else to put this.
It’s taken me so long to do this.
I’m falling asleep and I can’t see straight.

My muscles feel like a melee,
My body’s curled in a U-shape.
I put on my best, but I’m still afraid.

Propped up by lies and promises.
Saving my place as life forgets.
Maybe it’s time I saw the world.

I’m only here for a while.
And patience is not my style,
And I’m so tired that I got to go.

What am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
Did you really think I wouldn’t see this through?

Tell me I should stick around for you.
Tell me I can have it all.
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go.

I get to go home in one week.
But I’m leaving home in three weeks.
They throw me a bone just to pick me dry.

I’m following suit and directions.
I crawl up inside for protection.
I’m told what to do and I don’t know why.

I’m over existing in limbo.
I’m over the myths and placebos.
I don’t really mind if I just fade away.

I’m ready to live with my family.
I’m ready to die in obscurity
’Cause I’m so tired that I got to go.

Where am I supposed to hide now?
What am I supposed to do?
You still don’t think I’m gonna see this through?

Tell me I’m a part of history.
Tell me I can have it all.
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go.

I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
I’m still too tired to care and I got to go
