I am a dominant gene, live as I die
Never say forever ’cause forever’s a lie
I can see right through it so I can’t ignore you
The story changes but the ending will bore you

I tried to tell you but you simply obeyed
They didn’t listen so they threw you away
Now all you do is talk,
I don’t wanna hear your bullshit

Is this what you want?

(This is where it begins)
(This is where it ends)
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation,
They told us that we wouldn’t survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we’re all plenty alive
We know where you are and were coming
Let’s see you say that shit to our face

Thirty thirty-one fifty remembers
Thirty thirty-one fifty hates

In my own peculiar way I feel mercurial
Before I get ahead of myself again
I know the where but I still don’t know the when

You wanna live in a one sided world
Be prepared for a whole world of hurt
Now with the grand facade
I don’t want to be an angel
I just want to be God

They called us a dead generation,
They told us that we wouldn’t survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we’re all plenty alive
We know where you are and were coming
Lets see you say that shit to our face

Thirty thirty-one fifty remembers
Thirty thirty-one fifty (hates)
(hates)

(Yeah)

(Oh)
I am a fucking machine fueled by the past
Memory’s a memory until it’s a fact
I can bury the hatchet and let some shit go
But I got too many grudges to hold

Saw a lot of people die in the end
I never want to walk that road again
Now I will never give up
I don’t want to have it all,
I just want to have enough

(This is where it begins)
(This is where it ends)
This is where it begins
And this is where it ends

They called us a dead generation,
They told us that we wouldn’t survive
They left us alone in the maelstrom
As you can see we’re all (plenty alive)
We know where you are and were coming
Lets see you say that shit to our face

Thirty thirty-one fifty remembers
Thirty thirty-one fifty (hates)
