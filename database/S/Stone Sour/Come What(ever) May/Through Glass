I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
Oh God it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

’Cause I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
All I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

How do you feel? That is the question.
But I forget you don’t expect an easy answer.
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes.
You can’t expect a bit of hope.
So while you’re outside looking in
Describing what you see,
Remember what you’re staring at is me.

’Cause I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
All I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

How much is real? So much to question.
An epidemic of the mannequins contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart,
But never did right from the start.
Just listen to the noises.
(Null and void instead of voices).
Before you tell yourself it’s just a different scene,
Remember it’s just different from what you’ve seen.

I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
And all I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

’Cause I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
And all I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

And it’s the stars, the stars, that shine for you.
And it’s the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah-yeah.

And it’s the stars, the stars, that shine for you.
And it’s the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah-yeah.

I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
Oh God it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

’Cause I’m looking at you through the glass.
Don’t know how much time has passed.
All I know is that it feels like forever.
But no one ever tells you that forever feels like home,
Sitting all alone inside your head.

And it’s the stars, the stars, that shine for you, yeah-yeah.
And it’s the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah-yeah.

And it’s the stars, the stars, that shine for you, yeah-yeah.
And it’s the stars, the stars, that lie to you, yeah-yeah-yeah.

Who are the stars?
Who are the stars that lie?
