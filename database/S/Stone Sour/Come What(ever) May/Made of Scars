This one came from looking, this one opened twice
These two seemed smooth as silk, flush against my eyes
This one needed stitches, and this one came from rings
This one isn’t even there, but I feel it more because you don’t care

Yeah, cut right into me
Yeah, because I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars

This one had it coming, this one found a vein
This one was an accident, but never gave me pain
This one was my father’s, and this one you can’t see
This one had me scared to death
But I guess I should be glad I’m not dead

Yeah, cut right into me
Yeah, because I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars

Yeah

God, don’t you believe the hype?
God, don’t you believe the hype?
God, don’t you believe the hype?
God, don’t you believe the hype?

And I will find a way
Everything you are I will betray
Oh, I swear that I will find a way
Everything you are’s inside me

This one was the first one
This one had a vice
This one, here, I like to rub on dark and stormy nights
This one was the last one
I don’t remember how
But I remember blood and rain
And I never saw it coming again

Yeah, cut right into me
Yeah, because I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars
Yes, I am made of scars

That’s what I’m made of
