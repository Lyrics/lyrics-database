Why, is everything so gray, is everything so strange
Is everything so thrown together by mistake?
Why, is everything contrite, is everything a plight
Is everything so insincere and out of sight?

Why, does everything seem wrong,
Does everything look drawn,
Does everything seem blasted like it don’t belong?

I wanna make it a way, I wanna make it a waste
I wanna make it a gross misadventure
I wanna make you all!
I wanna make you all!
I wanna make you
Lie to me, lie to me

When, did everything go bad, did everything fall flat,
Did everything decay and lose itself so fast?
When, did everything succumb, did everything go numb,
Did everything lobotomize what it’s become?

When, does everything come back,
Does everything relapse,
Does everything save face and find itself at last?

I wanna show you the way, I wanna show you the waste
I wanna show you the worst misadventure
I wanna show you all!
I wanna show you all!
I wanna show you how to
Die for me, die for me

I wanna give it a way, I wanna give it the waste
I wanna give it the worst misadventure
I wanna give it all!
I’m gonna give it all!
I’ll never give up!
Lie to me, die for me

Now, everything’s a lie, everything’s your lie
Everything’s a face inside another lie
Now, everything’s a side, everything’s one side
Everything depends on just which side you’re on
