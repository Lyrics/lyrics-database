I’m not a victim ’til I let you take me down
I’m not a target in the sights of your mercy
I never asked for anything, I’m not asking now
I will not be afraid, I will not be afraid
I’ve done this on my own, and I don’t care what you do to me
I won’t hand over what is mine
I’ve done this for too long to let you take it away from me
It’s too late to stop me ’cause I refuse to die
I haven’t weakened just because I’ve shown myself
I’ve taken everything except what’s for granted
I’ll leave hypocrisy for everybody else

I will not be afraid, I will not be afraid

I’ve done this on my own, and I don’t care what you do to me
I won’t hand over what is mine
I’ve done this for too long to let you take it away from me
It’s too late to stop me ’cause I refuse to die

I’m not a problem ’til you make one out of spite
I’ll give you hell and consequences for trying
If you don’t want an enemy, don’t fuck with my life!

I will not be afraid - I will not be afraid

I’ve done this on my own, and I don’t care what you do to me
I won’t hand over what is mine
I’ve done this for too long to let you take it away from me
It’s too late to stop me ’cause I refuse to die

I’ve done this on my own, and I don’t care what you do to me
I won’t hand over what is mine
I’ve done this for too long to let you take it away from me
It’s too late to stop me ’cause I refuse, I refuse to die

I refuse to die
