I am walking through your streets
I am looking in your windows
I am elemental now
You’ll never even know I’m there

I am watching over you
I am living in the shadows
I am just a word to you, but I am very real and cold
Cold to all of this
Cold to how you feel
Cold to all your loose reason

Oh

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be

Yeah

I am all there is to know
I am all that you’ve forgotten
I am enigmatic now
You never even knew my name
I am dressed in tragedy
I am by design immortal
I am just the last one left but I am always here and old
Old and very strong
Old as all you feel
Old as all the world around you

Yeah

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)

I am just a secret now
I am just a vague illusion
I’m a lie you tell yourself that you never truly did believe
I’m a whisper in the dark
I’m a victim, and the killer
I am almost ready now but you insist I don’t exist
That I don’t exist
That I don’t exist
That I don’t exist

Oh

I am everything
I am anything
I am automatic
I am yesterday
I am everyday
I am gonna be
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)
Reborn
(this is the start of something)

Yeah

Ah ah ah

Motherfucker
Motherfucker
Motherfucker
