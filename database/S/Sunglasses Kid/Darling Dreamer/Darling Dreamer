You never thought it out
Your head stuck in the clouds
Breaking all the rules
They say you’re just a fool

You’re never gonna be nothing
Never gonna do it right
Unless you let that fire out
Let it run through the night

(An outline of a man)
(Heavy with illusion)
There’s no return
Unless you let that fire burn

So they see your hands like leather building mountains
One step closer to being hopeless wonder
Your vision will change everything
Oh, darling dreamer

You’re testing by pressure
Everyone bets against you
You’re inching in closer
With nothing left to lose

’Cause you don’t give a damn
(You’re never gonna be nothing)
You wanna see each face
(Never gonna do it right)
That said to you
(Unless you let that fire out)
You’ll never go no place
(Let it run through the night)
It’s just like a fool
To think that you can change
The human race
(Unless you let that fire burn)

So they see your hands like leather building mountains
One step closer to being hopeless wonder
Your vision will change everything
Oh, darling dreamer

So they see your hands like leather building mountains
(So they see your hands like leather building mountains)
(One step closer to being hopeless wonder)
One step closer to being hopeless wonder
(Counting stars to wish on one)
(Your eyes can see a new galaxy)
Your vision will change everything
Oh, darling dreamer
