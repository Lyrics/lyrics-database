Take what you want
I chase what I need
Your kiss makes me weak
I’m lost when you leave

(when you leave)

You take all I have to give
I’m gonna break if I can’t feel your lips
I need you desperately
I wish you’d tell me what to do
I’ll be anything you want me to
I need you desperately

I’m caught up in the chase
When the door shuts I feel as though you
Never loved me, never loved me
Turn around and run my way
I’m tearing apart, tearing apart

Oh come back to me
I need your love now
Oh come back to me
I need your love now

(need your love)

I walk down the lonely street
Your face in everything I see
I’m begging you, begging you please
I’ll never find another man
Who can take ahold of me like you can
I’m down on my knees begging you please

I’m caught up in the chase
When the door shuts I feel as though you
Never loved me, never loved me
Turn around and run my way
I’m tearing apart, tearing apart

Oh come back to me
I need your love now
Oh come back to me
I need your love now

Come back to me
I need your love now (need your love, need your love, need your love)
Oh come back to me
I need your love now (tearing apart)

Come back to me
I need your love now (need your love, need your love, need your love)
Oh come back to me
I need your love now (tearing apart)

(tearing apart, tearing apart, tearing apart)
