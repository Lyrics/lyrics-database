If only night could grow longer (longer, longer)
As I am getting no answer
The time to wake just draw closer (closer, closer)
Lest all our nights would show closure

Closer and closer to you
Remember the night in the stars

Through the night it’s never ending
Though the world is asleep in hollow
Memories lie in your wake

Careless motions in the moment
Play it off to the sound we all know
Blazing the night as we go

Closer and closer to you
Remember the night in the stars

Through the night it’s never ending
Though the world is asleep in hollow
Memories lie in your wake

Careless motions in the moment
Play it off to the sound we all know
Blazing the night as we go
