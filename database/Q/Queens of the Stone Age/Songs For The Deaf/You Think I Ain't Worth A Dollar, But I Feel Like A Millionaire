K-L-O-N Los Angeles
Clone radio we play the songs that sound
More like everyone else
Than anyone else
Clone

Hey alright, it’s Kip Kasper, Clone radio
LA’s infinite repeat
How we feelin’ out there?
How’s your drive time commute?
I need a saga. What’s the saga?
It’s "Songs for the Deaf"
You can’t even hear it

Dead bull with the life from the low
I’ll be massive conquistador
Give me soul and show me the door
Metal heavy, soft at the core
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Pressurize, neutralize
Deep fried, gimme some more

Space trucking, four on the floor
Fortified with the liqour store
This one’s down, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more

Shrunken head I love to adore
B-movie, gimme some gore
Gimme toro, gimme some more
B-movie, gimme some gore!

Uh!

Yow!

Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
Gimme toro, gimme some more
