I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future
And my dreams all fade away

I have burned my tomorrows
And I stand inside today
At the edge of the future
And my dreams all fade away

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

I faced my destroyer
I was ambushed by a lie
And you judged me once for falling
This wounded heart will rise

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever

When I see the light
True love forever (burn my shadow)
When I see the light
True love forever
When I see the light
True love forever (burn my shadow)
When I see the light
True love forever (away)

And burn my shadow away
And burn my shadow away

Oh, how I loved you
