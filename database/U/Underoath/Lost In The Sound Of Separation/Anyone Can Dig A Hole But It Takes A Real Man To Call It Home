I'm no leader I'm just a mess
It's not the way it's supposed to be
It's just the way that it is

I'm afraid we are all victims here
And the one whose in charge
I've lead us all astray again

Oh, how the plot thickens!
Are we too far gone?
Are we too far gone?
We always assume the worst
We always assume the worst

I'm afraid no ones listening anymore
I'm freaking out
I'm so sick
I'm making me sick
Don't look down
Don't look down

The only thing in my way is myself
I'm just thinking out loud
I'm just thinking
How can I still be alive
I shoulda been gone so long, so long ago

I can't get away from it all
I messed up like I always do
I gave you nothing
I took you nowhere
You're still listening

I gave you nothing
I took you nowhere
You're still listening

The world around me
Has taken a turn for the worst
I'm left alone
Climbing to the top

Should I jump should I stay
Can I make another day
Should I jump should I stay

I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
I am the one who's wrong
God forgive me
