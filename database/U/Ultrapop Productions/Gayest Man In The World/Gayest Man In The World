It all started on a warm November’s night
I was feelin’ blue, I wasn’t feelin’ alright
I ran the light, and I stubbed my toe
My body aches, and my brother’s on the death row
Then I got an epiphany and I felt great
I’d go to the old wizard to set me straight!

I’m the gayest man in the world
Just a tough guy who gets all the girls
I’m just so glad just to exist
Just too handsome to resist

I was upset as anyone could be
I approached the wizard’s shack at a quarter to three
It seemed everyone was jovial, except for me
Until I got me some gay conversion therapy
Afterwards I was happy, joyful, and most of all, gay
I’m proud to announce that the wizard made me that way

I’m the gayest man in the world
Just a tough guy who gets all the girls
I’m just so glad just to exist
Just too handsome to resist

Afterwards I found me a wife, a house, and kids
I went to New York and found a Broadway gig
I felt on top of the world, I felt big
The manager said while in his wig,
"Wouldn’t you be my guinea pig?"
I obliged and sucked his—

I’m the gayest man on the Earth
Like Jesus, I was rebirthed
I’m just so glad just to exist
Just too handsome to resist
