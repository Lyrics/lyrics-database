Sometimes
When I feel down
It seems so
Like I’m insane
And it looks like a never-ending hole

Then I can’t feel
Anything, no
Everything is
Meaningless
Day after day my time slips away

When I drop me
When I’ve lost myself
No one sees me
But I need that
And the sticky hole sucks me in

I feel lifeless
Something drives me
I’m controlled by threads
Connected to my hands and feet

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

But I’m routined
So I stand up
And I change place
Search new ways
But my thoughts go round in circles

When I go out
Get in contact
When I feel you
When you see me
Piece by piece my life returns

And I will fly
Away from my fears

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

And I will fly
Away from my fears
And I will fly
To find myself

And I will fly
Away from my fears
