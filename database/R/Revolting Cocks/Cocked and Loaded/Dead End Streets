I never should have made it, but I’m still alive
With a passion for destruction and a love for fire
I remain when it falls apart
Like the burning episodes of blackened heart

Hey-hey-ey!
Heh-heh-eh!

Just a remider that no one cares
Starin’ into space like nobody’s there
Bulletproof and ten feet tall
I ain’t gonna sleep until I’ve seen it all

Look into my eyes, you’ll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end
(Streets)

Out of control and misunderstood
I never been kin to anything good
Broke every promise that I ever made
Took everything that I ever gave

Look into my eyes, you’ll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end
(Streets)

(Dead end streets)
(Dead end streets)
(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets

The kinda trouble you wish you’d never met
A terrible secret you would love to forget
The feeling like you’re coming down from tripping too long
The choice to make when it all goes wrong

Look into my eyes, you’ll see dead end streets
A lot of sad faces and a lot of bad days

(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end!
(Dead end streets)
Dead end
(Streets)

(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)

(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)
Dead end streets
(Dead end streets)
