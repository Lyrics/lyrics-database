Fire engine, fire engine, get in the race
Gotta be the first one to my baby’s place

’Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine fire engine go-go-go
Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine take me where I want to go

Fire engine
Fire engine

Fire engine, fire engine, put out the fire
Burning up the bottom of my animal desire

Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine, fire engine, go-go-go
Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine, take me where I want to go

Fire engine
Fire engine

Get it boy!

Fire engine, come out, drive me insane
Pushin’ kids off the ceiling, it’s in my brain

Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine, fire engine, go-go-go
Fire engine’s fast, fire engine slow
Fire engine take me where I want to go

Fire engine
Fire engine

Beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep, beep-beep
Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep

Well come on,
All aboard
Fire engine.
Light my fire!
