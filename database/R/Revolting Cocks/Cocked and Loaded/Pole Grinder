Bein’ a man or bein’ a woman
Has nothing to do with your genitallia.
It has to do with what’s right in your heart.

(Man? Or woman? Or both?)

She’s got a reason to lie
She’s got a reason to cry
How she was born as guy
Kiss your good mother goodbye

Shake it now, shake it now, shake it now

Why do I dance?
That’s a good question.
I’m dancing to pay for my operation.

(Man? Or woman? Or both?)

She’s got a surprise
She’s a he in disguise
Concealing all is wise
Tucking it up to down size

Shake it now, shake it now, shake it now

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, yes I’m loving myself

On the good days I feel like I get it, like it all makes sense.
I can stay in the moment, I don’t have to control everything in the future.
On the bad days I just wanna grab the phone and start dialing numbers.

Pole grinder

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby

Pole grinder

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby

Pole grinder

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby

Pole grinder

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, yes I’m loving myself

Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby, I’m loving myself
Loving it baby
