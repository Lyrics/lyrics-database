Get around, get around, I get around

Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers

Stainless steel providers,
Make it obvious-
We like driving the point home,
A hundred thousand vagabond insects
All making a meal out of stainless steel
You should kick away the watchword
And throw caution to the wind
Remember what it’s like
When we are
Screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming
Screaming, dreaming, screaming, dreaming…
Stainless steel!

Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers

Get around, get around, I get around
When it’s time to go, I’m the first to know
A parasitic nation!
Is it good enough for me?
I’ll make you a mantra
From monkeys and car bombs
Beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath, beneath

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it’s real,
It’s all you mean to me
What’s that sound, what’s that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel,
And all it does to me

Stainless steel providers

Another tire
Let it catch on fire
A metal motor mantra
Makes you waste the time of day
You’ll sit on a time bomb, forever and ever
Now breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe!

Quick locate and detonate your public enemy
Stainless steel, believe it’s real,
It’s all you mean to me
What’s that sound, what’s that sound
It bleeds efficiency
The way I feel on stainless steel,
And all it means to me

Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
Stainless steel providers
