I didn’t need these clothes anyway

RevCo! Let’s go!
RevCo! To our second home
RevCo! Let’s go!
RevCo! To our second home

You know the place not far from here
You know the place we’re going
You know the place in old El Paso
You know the place it’s got my lady

She’s got style
When she shakes her ass
She’s got class

Waking up in West Tex-y
God these girls are fucking sexy
Drinkin’ at the Red Parrot
Can hardly bear it

I know the place it’s bright and shining
I know the face so misleading

She knows the pace to swing her body
She knows the pace that I come running

She’s got style when she shakes her ass
She’s got class

Waking up in West Tex-y
God these girls are fucking sexy
Drinkin’ at the Red Parrot
I can hardly bear it

RevCo! Let’s go!
RevCo! To our second home
RevCo! Let’s go!
RevCo! To our second home

Oh shit, I’m gonna die in this town, aren’t I?

Come on, Come on, Come on
Come on, Come on, Come on
Come on, Come on, Come on
Come on, Come on, Come on

She’s got style

She’s got style
When she shakes her ass
She’s got class

Waking up in West Tex-y
God these girls are fucking sexy
Drinkin’ at the Red Parrot
Can hardly bear it

Waking up in West Tex-y
God these girls are fucking sexy
Drinkin’ at the Red Parrot
I can hardly bear it

Waking up in West Tex-y
God these girls of fucking sexy
Al took their gator one day
Luc and Joey drunk on Sunday

RevCo! Let’s go! RevCo! To our second home
RevCo! Let’s go! RevCo! To our second home
RevCo! Let’s go! RevCo! To our second home
