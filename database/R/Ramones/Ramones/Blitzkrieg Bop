Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
Blitzkrieg Bop

They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're formin' in a straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Shoot 'em in the back now
What they want, I don't know
They're all revved up and ready to go

They're formin' in straight line
They're goin' through a tight wind
The kids are losin' their minds
The Blitzkrieg Bop

They're pilin' in the back seat
They generate steam heat
Pulsatin' to the back beat
The Blitzkrieg Bop

Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go
