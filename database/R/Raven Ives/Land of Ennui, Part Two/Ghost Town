Silhouettes of yesterdays
Weave a maze of fallen dreams
I walk alone in the pathways of time
Dreams in poison ivy
Come find me

Ghost town
Breathless now
I’m dying in your gardens
Haunted silhouettes of crying silence
I lost my way
Faded in your arms

Killing time, hoping the sky
Would guide me through the madness
I’m feeling your eyes are hiding behind the night
Behind the clouds, come find me
I’m here, waiting for your hand to reach and pull me
Out of this

Ghost town
Breathless now
I’m dying in your gardens
Haunted silhouettes of crying silence
I lost my way
Faded in your arms

I watch the world passing me by
And I feel so close, I feel so far behind (far behind)
Vines sprawl out as I try to run
Tendrils twining around my feet
Fate in poison ivy
Come find, come find me

Lost the sense of time here
Days don’t ever end here
Dying in your arms here
Beds of sullen flowers in here
Miracles are denied here
Seasons don’t really count here
Silhouettes of time here
Dreams are always only smoke and mirrors here
