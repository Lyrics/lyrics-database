Come on hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I’ve been given

I sit and talk to God
And he just laughs at my plans
My head speaks a language
I don’t understand

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
’Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins, going to waste

I don’t wanna die
But I ain’t keen on living either
Before I fall in love
I’m preparing to leave her

I scare myself to death
That’s why I keep on running
Before I’ve arrived
I can see myself coming

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
’Cause I got too much life
Running through my veins, going to waste

And I need to feel real love
And a life ever after
I cannot get enough…

I just wanna feel real love
Fill the home that I live in
I got too much love
Running through my veins, to go to waste

I just wanna feel real love
In a life ever after
There’s a hole in my soul
You can see it in my face, it’s a real big place

Come and hold my hand
I wanna contact the living
Not sure I understand
This role I’ve been given

Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
Not sure I understand
