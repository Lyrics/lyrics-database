I can still remember
The words and what they meant
As we etched them with our fingers
In years of wet cement

The days blurred into each other
Though everything seemed clear
We cruised along at half speed
But then we shifted gears

We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns
But even then, we should have stayed

But we ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

Identities assume us
As nine and five add up
Synchronizing watches
With the seconds that we lost
And I looked up and saw you
I know that you saw me
We froze but for a moment
In empathy

I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug
You gave my emptiness a name

And you ran away
Now all my friends are gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?

We’re all OK, until the day we’re not
The surface shines, while the inside rots
We raced the sunset and we almost won
We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on

And we ran away
Now all my friends gone
Maybe we’ve outgrown all the things that we once loved
Run away
But what are we running from?
A show of hands from those in this audience of one
Where have they gone?
