The day I learn to fly
I’m never coming down
On perfect wings I’ll rise
Through the layers of the clouds

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

I see myself inside you
You dream the dreams that I do
You’re still searching for these answers
They’re not inside your wrist

And from there I see the neon grids of cities
Where six million people that can keep their fires lit

And I threw a party in my name
But the hours crawled by and no one came
So I bowed my head and I prayed for wings
To take me from this place from you

And I close my eyes as the curtains draw
I thought I heard your voice but I thought wrong
’Cause you’re not there anymore
No, you’re not there anymore

And so I lift my chin as the show goes on
The sky is listening, the stars all sing along
But you’re not there anymore
And I just can’t care anymore
