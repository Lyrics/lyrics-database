Our building have fallen, our walls all caved in
And we can’t comprehend this sad state that we’re in
So we sift through the ashes of what we’ve become
And surrender here one by one
So push us down

And we get right back up again
The things you’re telling me aren’t making any sense
Right back up again
I’m sick of wishing for someone else to come

Let the blind lead the blind
’Cause it’s eye for an eye in your so called life
Are you out there? Are you listening?
Is there something we’re still missing?

Let the blind lead the blind
’Cause it’s eye for an eye
We all fall down

And we get right back up again
The things you’re telling me aren’t making any sense
Right back up again
I’m sick of wishing for someone else to come

We’re spinning out of control
We’re trying to find somewhere to land
And I don’t want you to know
The things that keep me down

’Cause we get right back up again
The things you’re telling me aren’t making any sense
Right back up again
I’m sick of wishing for someone else to come
