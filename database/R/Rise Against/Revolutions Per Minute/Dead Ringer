I never claimed to be something more than me
Your standards I refuse to see
I will answer only to myself
So why don’t you police someone else

The place I call home isn’t there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit
Let this be the end of it

Once you held a place for me
But now that I’ve left you went and gave up my seat
Don’t expect me to share your visions of life
I’ll take the chances somewhere else

The place I call home isn’t there anymore
With boards on the windows and locks on the door
So pick up the pieces that never once fit
Let this be the end of it

Give me the green light to get on with my life
Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice
Give me the green light to get on with my life
Pick up the pieces then roll the fucking dice

I live in exile of you, your key no longer fits
Because the locks on my life are new
