Is this the point where we give up?
Now is this the point where we give in?
Now is this the point where we turn ourselves in?

Or is this the time to ask questions?
Or is this the time to seek answers?
Now is this the time to throw it all in?

When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
You’re halfway there
That’s when you know that you’re halfway there

This is the point where we stand up
Now this is the point where we take back
The things that are keeping us from being free

So when enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there
When enough is enough that’s when you know that you’re halfway there

Woah, woah
Your voice the airwaves sent you prayed my life would end
Woah, woah
The wasted time I spent ashamed I called you friend
Woah, woah
Give me one reason, I need a reason
Woah, woah
Give me one reason, I need a reason, one reason
