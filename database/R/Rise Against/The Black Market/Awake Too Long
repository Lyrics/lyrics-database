I watched the rise and the fall of the common man
I lived to see all our steps walked back
I watched the walls all crash down crumbling
Just to be rebuilt while we slept

We threw swords in the oceans wide and deep
We promise peace but the peace won’t last
Because now we forge new blades so nervously
Waiting for this harmony to pass

I stand guard and roam
Like a sentinel and I see it all

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep

We fell in love but the love kept running out
We followed roads but the roads all end
We lived and learned and learned to live without
Falling from the ladders we ascend

I’ve seen the eyes of the widows left behind
I’ve seen the child of a fallen man
And never once did our leaders apologize
For battles they began

Can’t look away
Or pretend not to see and so I stay

I’ve been awake too long
Wish there was something
That could close my eyes to all that I see
Awake too long, it would be easier to fall asleep, asleep

Maybe I would dream if I could sleep
Maybe I’d see what this could be
Instead of what it is
Is there bliss in ignorance
Is this our demise we can’t prevent
Should we fall asleep?

I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long
I’ve been awake too long

(I’ve been awake too long) And like constant vigils
(I’ve been awake too long) We are burning eternal flames
(I’ve been awake too long) A surgery, blades in an open heart
(I’ve been awake too long) And through it all, it all
Every single cut, I’ve been awake
