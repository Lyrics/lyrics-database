Settling in here for the long haul
Can’t hide forever is what they say
In with the wind, out with a bang
Meanwhile nothing has changed

With each word slowly uttered
A storm brews in her eyes
A missed shot at the buzzard
Time, whether wasted
Or well-spent, is still time

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don’t recognize
But we return here all together

Moments of clarity here are short-lived
Bled through the bandages again
When is a lie no longer white
But black as a day without sun

Passed out in a gutter
Woke up in your arms
Nursed back and recovered
The same touch that heals me
Left a scar

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the end of the longest lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
We came back to homes we don’t recognize
But we return here all together

And the world works in ways that I never have claimed to know
We got out in front of the weather but it followed
The view from here isn’t better but it’s all we know
It’s all we know

We are not brave, we are not wise
We stand at the edge of the border lines
But we stand here all together
We have been damned, we have survived
Who we’ve become you won’t recognize
But we became them all together
All together
