It was me on that road
But you couldn’t see me
Too many lights out,
But nowhere near here

It was me on that road
Still you couldn’t see me
And then flashlights,
And explosions

Roads are getting nearer
We cover distance but not together

I am the storm
And I am the wonder
And the flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosions

I don’t know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish

It’s about you and the Sun
A morning run
The story of my maker
What I have and what I ache for

I’ve got a golden ear
I cut and I spear

What else is there?

Roads are getting nearer
We cover distance still not together

If I am the storm?
If I am the wonder?
Will I have flashlights, nightmares,
And sudden explosion?

There’s no room where I can go and
You’ve got secrets too

I don’t know what more to ask for
I was given just one wish
