I’m not waiting
For a king
To rule my mind
Or anything

I don’t need your
Band of gold
To take me where I need to go

A simple man
Well he could do more
But you can only see the traces
That have gone before

There’s an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife
When you lay your head down
There’s a castle of sand
That gets kicked in your face
To see how easily you’d fall from grace
There’s a piece of dust
That crumbles in your hand
If you decide to lose control
No one can escape
When you find out they’re fake
And you want to take the whole lot down

A simple man
Well he could do more
But you can only see the traces
That have gone before

There’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
If you walk the white line
There’s a piece of dust that crumbles in your hand
If you decide to lose control
There’s a castle of sand that gets kicked in your face
To see how easily you’d fall from grace
Yes, there’s a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow

There’s an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife
When you lay your head down
You know you can’t escape
When you find out they’re fake
And you want to take the whole lot down
There’s no truth in the lie that only angels cry
When everybody knows we’re all born to die
There’s an edge to life
That will cut you like a knife

I miss you
There’s no power that is such a thrill
That can make a man or anything

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you

I miss you
