Come on, the night is young
Seek me out
Because I’m ready to get stung
So long, so long (so long, so long)
Feed me

Come on, show me
Come on, need me
Come on, show me the way
Come on, need me in that way

So long

You just never ever get what you want! (get what you want)
You just never ever get what you need! (get what you need)
You just never ever get what you want! (get what you want)
You just never ever get what you need! (get what you need)

Come on, you deserve me
Come on, it’s the thought of you in my veins
Come on, show me the way
Come on, show me the feeling

So long

You just never ever get what you want! (get what you want)
You just never ever get what you need! (get what you need)
You just never ever get what you want! (get what you want)
You just never ever get what you need! (get what you need)

Get what you want!
Get what you need!
