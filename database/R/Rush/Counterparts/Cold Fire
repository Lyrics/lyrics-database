Cold fire
Such a cold fire
It’s a cold fire
It’s a cold fire

It was long after midnight
When we got to unconditioned love
She said, “Sure my heart is boundless,
But don’t push my limits too far”

I said, “If love is so transcendent,
I don’t understand these boundaries”
She said, “Just don’t disappoint me,
You know how complex women are”

I’ll be around
If you don’t let me down too far
I’ll be around
If you don’t let me down

It was just before sunrise
When we started on traditional roles
She said, “Sure, I’ll be your partner,
But don’t make too many demands”

I said, “If love has these conditions,
I don’t understand those songs you love”
She said, “This is not a love song,
Thes isn’t fantasyland”

(Don’t go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
(Don’t cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
(Don’t let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker’s diamond
Is a cold fire
(Don’t break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door
Is a cold fire

I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down too far
I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down

I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down too far
I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down

(Don’t go too far)
A phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea
Is a cold fire
(Don’t cross the line)
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor
Is a cold fire
(Don’t let me down)
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker’s diamond
Is a cold fire
(Don’t break the spell)
The look in your eyes as you head for the door
Is a cold fire

I’ll be around
If you don’t let me down too far
I’ll be around
If you don’t let me down

I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down too far
I’ll be around
If you don’t push me down

I’ll be around
If you don’t let me down

(It’s a cold fire, fire, fire…)
Love is blind if you are gentle
(Such a cold fire, fire, fire…)

(It’s a cold fire, fire, fire…)
Love can turn to a long, cold burn
(Such a cold fire, fire, fire…)
