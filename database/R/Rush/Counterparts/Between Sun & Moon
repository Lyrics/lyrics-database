There is a lake between sun and moon
Not too many know about
In the silence between whisper and shout
The space between wonder and doubt

This is a fine place
Shining face-to-face
Those bonfire lights in the mirror of sky
The space between wonder and why

Ahh, yes to yes, to aah-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?
Ahh, yes to yes, to ahh-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?

There is a fine line between love and illusion â€”
A fine place to penetrate
The gap between actor and act
The lens between wishes and fact

This is a fine place
To hesitate
Those bonfire lights in the lake of sky
The time between wonder and why

Ahh, yes to yes, to aah-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?
Ahh, yes to yes, to ahh-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?

Some need to pray to the sun at high noon
Need to howl at the midwinter moon
Reborn and baptized in a moment of grace
Just need a break from the headlong race

This is a fine place
Shining face-to-face (shining face-to-face)
Those bonfire lights in the mirrored sky
The space between wonder and why

Ahh, yes to yes, to aah-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?
Ahh, yes to yes, to ahh-ahh, to yes
Why the sun, why the sun?
