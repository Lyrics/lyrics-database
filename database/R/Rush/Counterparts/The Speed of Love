Love is born with lightning bolts
Electro-magnetic force
Burning skin and fireworks
A storm on a raging course

Like a force of nature
Love can fade with the stars at dawn
Sometimes it takes all your strength
Just to keep holding on

At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Love is born with solar flares
From two magnetic poles
Moves towards a higher plane
Where two halves make two wholes

Like a force of nature
Love shines in many forms
One night you are bathed in light
One day get carried away in storms

At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster (nothing changes)
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Whoa-ah-oh-oh

We don’t have to talk (to talk)
We don’t even have to touch
I can feel your presence
In the silence that we share

Got to keep on moving
At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster
Than the speed of love
Got to keep on shining
At the speed of love

At the speed of love
A radiance that travels
At the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

At the speed of love
Nothing changes faster (nothing changes)
Than the speed of love
My heart goes out to you

Whoa-ah-oh-oh

At the speed of love

At the speed (at the speed) of love

At the speed (at the speed) of love

Whoa-ah-oh-oh

(At the speed of love)

At the speed of love

(At the speed of love)

At the speed of love
