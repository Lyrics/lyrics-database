In my dreams see I’m on TV
Get back exactly who I wanna be
If she could only see herself in my eyes
This wouldn’t be such a big surprise

I’m sick and tired
Of it getting in my way
I’m sick and tired
Of everything I seem I know

Nobody rides for free
Nobody rides for free

Don’t stop to think ’cause I know where I stand
I’m on my way, no you’re not gonna change my plan
If you can break away and see what I say
You’ll understand what I’m trying to be

I’m sick and tired
Of talking to my little dates
I’m sick and tired
Of everyone in my way

Nobody rides for free (nobody rides for free)
Nobody rides for free (nobody rides for free)
Nobody rides (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)

You’ve gotta pay to play
So don’t you stand in my way
’Cause nobody
Nobody rides for free

Now the world’s at stake
The card was drawn
You thought he could swim, but I guess you were wrong
You sink to the depths of your misery
Baby, the past will set you free

Nobody rides for free (nobody rides for free)
Nobody rides for free (nobody rides for free)
Nobody rides (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)
Nobody rides for free (nobody)

You’ve gotta pay to play
So don’t you stand in my way
’Cause nobody
Nobody rides for free

(Nobody rides for free)
(Nobody rides) for free
(Nobody) nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody
Nobody rides for free
(Nobody) nobody rides for free

Nobody
Nobody
Nobody rides for free

Nobody rides for free
Nobody nobody, nobody rides
Nobody rides for free

Nobody rides…
