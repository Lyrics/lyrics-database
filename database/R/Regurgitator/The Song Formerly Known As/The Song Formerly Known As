I don’t go to parties, baby
’Cause people tend to freak me out
Watch their lips to work it out
I can hear the words but I still don’t know what it’s all about

You won’t see me down the disco, mama
’Cause bright lights really hurt my eyes
I’d rather stay and dance with you
To the funky music playing on our stereo (oh)

Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me

I don’t go to concerts, baby
The music’s always up too loud
Cigarettes and alcohol get up my ass
I always lose you in the crowd, ye

You won’t see me tribal-raving, baby
’Cause I won’t ever look that good
I’d rather dance in ugly pants
In the comfort of a loungeroom in suburbia (oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me

(That’s right!)

Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me
Ooh-ooh, things don’t get no better
Better than you and me

(That’s right!)

Better than you and me
Better than you and me

[Thank you, Mr. DJ…]
