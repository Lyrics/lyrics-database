I was thinking just the other day
About you and me
I would drive ...
From town to town

On the roads and on the highways
Settling where we pleased
’Til I foolishly let go
And let you down

I assumed that there were something
Bigger than our good times
Something sweeter than
The simple life we shared

So for many years I moved along
Searching for that something
Now I see just what
A fool I was ...

And the world is like a carnival
It sometimes don’t seem fair
But still I suit up like a queen
And take my chances there

And I go round and round, and round and round
And round and round again
But I never found
Another man like you

Now I ... your funny face
And your smile revealing
How you gave me everything
Without a fight

And I hear that you are vanished goods
In a place I left you
So I hate myself
For wronging what was right

... myself
... many men ... leave ’em
... the one
... quite compared to you

And I’ve had my share of heartache
For some times they leave me grieving
On those days I turn my thoughts
To what I need

And the world is like a carnival
It sometimes don’t seem fair
But still I suit up like a queen
And take my chances there

And I go round and round, and round and round
And round and round again
But I never found
Another man like you

And the world is like a carnival
It sometimes don’t seem fair
But still I suit up like a queen
And take my chances there

And I go round and round, and round and round
And round and round again
But I never found
Another man like you
