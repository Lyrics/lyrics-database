Yeah

The world is my expense
It’s the cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

So raise your fists and march around
Just don’t take what you need
I’ll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed

Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I’ll drag you to your grave
I’m deep inside your children
They’ll betray you in my name

Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire

The lie is my expense
The scope of my desire
The party blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

I am the Niña, the Pinta, the Santa María
The noose and the rapist, the fields overseer
The Agents of Orange, the Priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire, sleep now in the fire

Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire
Hey, hey, sleep now in the fire

For it’s the end of history
It’s caged and frozen still
There is no other pill to take
So swallow the one that made you ill

The Niña, the Pinta, the Santa María
The noose and the rapist, the fields overseer
The Agents of Orange, the Priests of Hiroshima
The cost of my desire to sleep now in the fire

Yeah

Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
Sleep now in the fire
