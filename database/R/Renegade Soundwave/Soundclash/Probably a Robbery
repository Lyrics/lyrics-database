I’m back to announce
Put some style in my accounts
Put your face in a trance
Pull my fist from your mouth

I’ve got my feet on the throne
I’m gonna slap you with tone
We’re going straight to the top
We’ve no reason to stop

Because it’s probably a robbery
A bit of skull duggery
The funniest thing
I just wanted to sing
But the notes wouldn’t come my way

Watch out!
There’s a thief about!
He’s picking locks and scaling walls, takes people for fools
If you want my advice, get it all above board
Just pop into Lloyd’s and get yourself insured

Because it’s probably a robbery
A bit of skull duggery
The funniest thing
I just wanted to sing
But the notes wouldn’t come my way

I was most distressed,
Where’s the sense of dress?
Balaclavas, trigger-happy, give me the rest
My character changed, I left the place in dread
The shooters on the counter, stockings over our heads

Because it’s probably a robbery
A bit of skull duggery
When I got outside I looked to my dismay
’Cause the getaway car just sped away

Probably a robbery

I heard alarm bells ringing, shouts of “stay where you are!”
There wasn’t time to blink
The flying squad moved in
Threw me arms in the air, slung down the bag with tools
The worst thing about it, I’d just booked me cruise

Because it’s probably a robbery
A bit of skull duggery
When I got outside I looked to my dismay
’Cause the getaway car just sped away

Probably a robbery

I didn’t want in
But committed the sin
Started as a dipper
But I married a stripper
At her Majesty’s pleasure
I’m here for the leisure
I’m here in wait
For a suitable date

And ’cause it’s probably a robbery

A bit of skull duggery
The funniest thing
I just wanted to sing
But the notes wouldn’t come my way

Probably a robbery

Probably a robbery

Probably a robbery

Probably a robbery
