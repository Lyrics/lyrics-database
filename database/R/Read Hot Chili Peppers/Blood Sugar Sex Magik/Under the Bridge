Sometimes I feel like I don’t have a partner
Sometimes I feel like my only friend
Is the city I live in, the city of angel
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I drive on her streets ’cause she’s my companion
I walk through her hills ’cause she knows who I am
She sees my good deeds and she kisses me windy
I never worry, now that is a lie

I don’t ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don’t ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yea-yea, yea-yea…

It’s hard to believe that there’s nobody out there
It’s hard to believe that I’m all alone
At least I have her love, the city she loves me
Lonely as I am, together we cry

I don’t ever wanna feel like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way
I don’t ever wanna feel, like I did that day
Take me to the place I love, take me all the way, yea-yea, yea-yea…
Ooh-no, no-no, yea-yea
Love me, I say, yea-yea…

(Long time)

(Under the bridge downtown) is were I drew some blood
(Under the bridge downtown) I could not get enough
(Under the bridge downtown) forgot about my love
(Under the bridge downtown) I gave my life away, yea-yea, yea-yea…

Ooh-no, no-no, yea-yea
Here I stay, yea-yea…

Here I stay
