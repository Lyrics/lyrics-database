I used to think that I could not go on
And life was nothing but an distrustful song
But now I know the meaning of true love
I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
Spread my wings and fly away
I believe I can soar
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

See I was on the verge of breaking down
Sometimes silence can seem so loud
There are miracles in life I must achieve
But first I know it starts inside of me 
If I can see it, then I can be it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
spread wings and fly away
I believe I can soar 
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

Hey, 'cause I believe in you
Oh

If I can see it, then I can do it
If I just believe it, there's nothing to it

I believe I can fly
I believe I can touch the sky
I think about it every night and day
spread wings and fly away
I believe i can soar 
I see me running through that open door
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly
I believe I can fly

If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
I can fly (I can fly)
If I just spread my wings (I can fly)
I can fly...(i can fly,i can fly)
woo... i can fly
hmmmmm...fly, fly, fly
