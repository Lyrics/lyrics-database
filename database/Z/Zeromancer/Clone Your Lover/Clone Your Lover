Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Hello-hello,
Who wants the same
Hello-hello
Calling your name
Hello-hello
Stole your soul
Hello-hello
Making you whole

When you're here (aaah-aah)
I don't care (aaah-aah)
What you say (aaah-aah)
what you say to me
As long as you say it

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone

Hello-hello
You want to know
Hello-hello
Who's taking control

When you're here (aaah-aah)
I don't care (aaah-aah)
What you say (aaah-aah)
What you say to me
As long as you say it to me

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
(wish there was something I could do)
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
(wish there was something else but you)
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
(wish you were all the same but new)
Clone your lover

Clone, Clone
Clone your lover
(wish that I could be with you)
Clone your lover

Clone
