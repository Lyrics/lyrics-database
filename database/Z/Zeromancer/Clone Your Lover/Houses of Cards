How can you stand there and deny it
After all we have been through…
How can you stand there and deny it
And make a fool out of you…

Collapsing like houses of cards
And landing on splinters and glass

Wish I could fake it like you do
(Wish I could fake it like you do)
Wish I could fake it just like you
(Wish I could fake it just like you)

How can you stand there, deny it?
How can you stand there and deny it?

Trust me now

Collapsing like houses of cards
And landing on splinters and glass

They crush your heart
But spare your feet
Like judging people
You’ve yet to meet
Well time is running fast
Upon your reflection

Trust me now
Trust me now
Trust me now
(How can you stand there?)

Trust me now
(Stand and deny it?)

Trust me now
(How can you stand there?)

Trust me now
(Stand and deny it?)

Trust me now
(How can you stand there?)

Trust me now
(Stand and deny it?)
