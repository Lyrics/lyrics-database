Can’t you see my hands are clean?
I’m as holy as can be
I will never do you harm
I am fractured
It can never be the same

Can’t you see my hands are clean?
Can’t you see?
I’m as holy as can be

What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)
What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)

Can’t you see my hands are clean?
I’m as holy as can be
I will never do you harm again
I am fractured
It can never be the same

What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)
What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)

I warned you a thousand times
It’s like crying to the clouds

And why are you asking me questions
You already know the answer to?

Can’t you see my hands are clean?

What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)
What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)

A good life

What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)

A good life

What kind of life is this?
(What kind of life is this?)

A good life
Is a quiet life
A good life
Is a quiet life
