I see you out on the dancefloor shaking around
I see you out on an empty beach
I see you walking a one way street
It’s the same as always

A star
Maybe you are
A star
Maybe you are

A new Madonna

In a way I can hear myself say
What is it worth?
I say we meet on the last place on Earth
It’s insane as always

A star
Maybe you are
A star
Maybe you are
A star
Maybe you are

A new Madonna

Maybe you are
A star
Maybe you are

A new Madonna

A new Madonna

A new Madonna

Is this the only way
You make it like a new Madonna?

Is this the only way
You make it like a new Madonna?

Is this the only way
You make it like a new Madonna?
