Guys are drooling over you
Sampling your soul
You could be the chosen one
But what if
Everything they say is wrong
And you die some?

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star

Sometimes you feel so skinny
It’s like you don’t even exist
Lolita never been kissed

You gotta feel what can be felt
Touch what can be touched
Do what can be done
But don’t

(Die young)
(Die young)

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star

Against all odds again
You got zip to lose

Against all odds again
You got zip to lose

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star

Everlasting teenage recoil
Fall in love with anything
Come undone with hearts unbroken
And wish upon a lucky star
