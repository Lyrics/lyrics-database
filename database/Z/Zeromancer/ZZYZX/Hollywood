It’s a real thing
Safety’s off
Are you there?
Are you there for me?
By my side
An angel
Who dodge the bullets wide

It feels right
On a beach when you talk
You talk without a sound
And when you walk
Your feet hardly touch the ground

But you’re there by my side
But you’re there for me

When all this is over
Heaven knows I’m going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

It wears off
Like lipstick on your skin
Like a day that won’t begin
Waking up
And you can’t remember
Where you’ve been

But you’re there by my side
But you’re there for me

When all this is over
Heaven knows I’m going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

When all this is over
Heaven knows I’m going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

It’s time
We get things straight
Are you there?
Are you there for me?
Back for good
At 6 AM in Hollywood

When all this is over
Heaven knows I’m going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning

When all this is over
Heaven knows I’m going nowhere
I was only dreaming
Censored for a deeper meaning
