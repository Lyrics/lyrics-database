Do you believe in heaven above?
Do you believe in love?
Don’t tell a lie
Don’t be false or untrue
It all comes back to you

Open fire on my burning heart
I’ve never been lucky in love
My defences are down
A kiss or a frown?
Can’t survive on my own

And if a girl walks in
And carves her name in my heart
I’ll turn and run away
Everyday we’ve all been led astray
It’s hard to be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It’s making you cry
Don’t know what to do (don’t know what to do)
You’re looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Empty dreams can only disappoint
In a room behind your smile
But don’t give up (don’t give up)
Don’t give up (don’t give up)
You can be lucky in love

It gets in your eyes
It’s making you cry
Don’t know what to do (don’t know what to do)
You’re looking for love
Calling heaven above

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

Send me an angel
Send me an angel
Right now
Right now

It gets in your eyes
It’s making you cry
Don’t know what to do (don’t know what to do)

Send me an angel (send me an angel)
Send me an angel (send me an angel)
Right now
Right now

Send me an angel (send me an angel)
Send me an angel (send me an angel)
Right now
Right now

Send me an angel
Right now
Right now
