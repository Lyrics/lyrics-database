We ain’t nothing
But eurotrash
We take plastic
And we take cash

We’re selling an image
Everything must go
(I want you to know)
You don’t want the side FX
(You wanna .com)
New simulated sex

We’re selling you heaven
Prices down to a low
(I thought you should know)

It’s all in your head
You’re living a lie
There is nothing
Money can’t buy

We ain’t nothing
But eurotrash
We take plastic
And we take cash

We sell our hearts
Second class
We slit our throats on
Tinted glass

We’re silicon stitches
Reality bites hard
(I want you to know)
It’s all in your head
You’re living a lie
There is nothing money can’t buy

We ain’t nothing
But eurotrash
We take plastic
And we take cash

We sell our hearts
Second class
We slit our throats on
Tinted glass

(We are, we are, we are, we are)

It’s all in your head
You’re living a lie
There is nothing money can’t buy

The future is here
Dreams have no end
Everything must go

We ain’t nothing
But eurotrash
We take plastic
And we take cash

We sell our hearts
Second class
We slit our throats on
Tinted glass
