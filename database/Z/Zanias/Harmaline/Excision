Softly warm, we bloom apart here.
The ache of the dawn of a change that’s so clear,
I warned you.

Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…
Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…

Skin that could soothe, I had to know you,
but the garden’s grown, the thorns have stung…
I had to make the call, bleed it out, drain the love
and let you go.

Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…
Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…

Drain the love and let you go.
Drain the love and let you go.
Drain the love and let you go.
Drain the love and let you go.

Drain the love and let you go.

Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…
Don’t you run so far ahead of me now…
