Who will be the last to die?
Who will see the final light
across the sky?

But the sun will rise again,
the sun will rise again
without us.
Without us.
Without us.
Without us.

Who will be the last to die?
Who will think the final thought
in the universe?

But the sun will rise again,
the sun will rise again.

The ocean will swell and surge,
and the sun will rise again
without us.
Without us.
Without us.

The sun will rise again,
the sun will rise again.

The ocean will swell and surge,
and the sun will rise again
without us.
Without us.
Without us.
Without us.

The sun will rise again.
The sun will rise again.
The sun will rise again.
The sun will rise again.
