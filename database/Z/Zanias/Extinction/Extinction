Our only hope is to fade away,
lost in time
like tears in rain.

Darling, I know
it feels unreal
to go.

Our only hope is to fade away,
lost in time
like tears in rain.

Blood won’t sit still.
Blood won’t sit still.
Blood won’t sit still.
Blood won’t sit still.
Blood won’t sit still.

Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away,
lost in time
like tears in rain.

Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.

Our only hope is to fade away.
