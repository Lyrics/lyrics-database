Our only hope is to fade away:
lost in time
like tears in rain.

Darling, I know,
it feels unreal to go…

Our only hope is to fade away:
lost in time
like tears in rain.

The blood won’t sit still.
The blood won’t sit still.
The blood won’t sit still.
The blood won’t sit still.
The blood won’t sit still.

Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away:
lost in time
like tears in rain.

Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.
Our only hope is to fade away.

Our only hope is to fade away.
