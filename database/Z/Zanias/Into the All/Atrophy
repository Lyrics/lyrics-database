I could pick you up where you fell,
I could tell you that it won’t be hard,
I could walk you out of the rain,
I could talk you out of the pain.
All the ways I’ve done.
all the ways I’ve done…
but I can’t anymore.
I can’t anymore.

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.

I could pick you up where you fell,
I could tell you that it won’t be hard,
I could walk you out of the rain,
I could talk you out of the pain!

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.

’Til you’re out of the woods
you walk alone.
