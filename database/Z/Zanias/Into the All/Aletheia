Guarded from the outside in,
I caught your eye
across the room...
No surprise,
it’s withering and cruel,
and blood runs cold
knowing what we had before,
and it’s clear as it ever was
the truth of us.

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
divided, alone,
ghosts in a shell.
It’s so out of my control,
these walls we can never
dismantle.
How could I
have thought it possible
for scalp and skull
to dissolve?
To dissolve?

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
untied, undone.
Strangers, still.

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
divided, alone,
ghosts in a shell.

This is who we are (this is who we are)
This is who we are
This is who we are

We were somewhere gone together,
(This is who we are)
now the fortress stands
as high as ever.

This is who we are, we are, we are, we are:
untied and undone,
strangers still.

This is who (we are, we are, we are)
This is who (we are)
This is who (we are)
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
Untied and undone
This is who (we are)
