Streaks of arriving light
stain the sky.
Survived another night
on this rock,
not knowing why.

Streaks of arriving light
feed the fire.
Horizonâ€™s alight
as we turn and watch,
not knowing why.

We turn like abandoned gods,
confounded by change.
It shakes us all,
distilled in our eyes:
we rise an fall,
we rise and rise,
it breaks us all.
Distilled in our eyes:
we rise and fall,
we rise and rise
not knowing why.
Not knowing why.
