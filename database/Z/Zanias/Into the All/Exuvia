We may be young but we know how it goes;
we learn the rules as we watch them fall
one by one.

The circle closes inward;
we’re all just passing through.
Passing through.
Passing through.
Passing through.

Our faith is gone but we know how it goes;
we learn the rules as we lay them down
one by one.

The circle closes inward;
we’re all just passing through.
We’re passing through,
we’re passing through,
and so are you.
And so are you.

Consciousness,
warmth and breath:
impermanent.
Impermanent.

Consciousness,
warmth and breath:
impermanent.
Impermanent.

Impermanent.
Impermanent.
Impermanent.
Impermanent.

I felt his heart slow as the struggle left him.
I saw his eyes close…
Muscle fell still.
Muscle fell still.
Muscle fell still.
Muscle fell still.

Closing inward.
Closing inward.

We’re all just passing through.
We’re passing through,
We’re passing through,
and so are you.

Impermanent.
Impermanent.

And so are you.
