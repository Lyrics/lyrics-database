The year is bleeding by
and I have no choice but to accept the way
our lives are turning out.
Would you have left him if you’d known
you’d only be alone?
Would you have left him if you’d known?

“Forever” is the falsest word.
It’s so impossible, it’s so absurd,
and yet we tie it to the things that surely die.
We tie it to the things that surely die.

And certainty is rare
but I know one thing for sure:
the universe will devastate us all.
The universe will devastate us all.

(So dry your eyes, dry your eyes)

At least I know I tried…
(So dry your eyes, dry your eyes)

At least I know I tried…
(So dry your eyes, dry your eyes)

The year is bleeding by
and I have no choice but to accept the way
our lives are turning out.
Would you have left him if you’d known
you’d only be alone?
Would you have left him if you’d known?

At least I know I tried…
(So dry your eyes, dry your eyes)

At least I know I tried…
At least I know I tried…
(So dry your eyes, dry your eyes)
