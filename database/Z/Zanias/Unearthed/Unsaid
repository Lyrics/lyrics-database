Here it goes again…
Here it comes again…
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?

Here it comes again…
Here it comes again…
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?

Here it comes again…
Here it comes again…
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?

Here it comes again…
Here it comes again…
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?
Are you bringing me down
or are you all I have?
