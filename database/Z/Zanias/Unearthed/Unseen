Show me all the ways that I’m missing out.
Show me all the ways that I’m nothing special.
Show me all the ways that you’ve never been happier
than today.
(Today) today…

Show me all the ways that I’m missing out.
Show me all the ways that I’m nothing special.
Show me all the ways that you’ve never been happier
than today.
(Today) today…

Show me all the love that I’ll never know.
Show me all the fear that it’s never perfect.
Show me all the smiles a million miles
away from me here.

I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.

I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.

(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)
(I may never let you go)

I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.
I’d like to see the light
and see the day.

I may never, may never let you go.
There’s nothing more wounded
than a woman in love.
I may never, may never let you go.
There’s nothing more wounded
than a woman in love.
I may never, may never let you go.
There’s nothing more wounded
than a woman in love.
I may never, may never let you go.
There’s nothing more wounded
than a woman in love.
