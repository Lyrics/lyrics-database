I want to break you open…
I want to break you open:
I found a mind I’d like to see,
I found a mind I’d like to explore
endlessly.

I want to break you open…
I want to break you open:
I found a mind I’d like to see,
I found a mind I’d like to explore
endlessly.

I want to break you open…
I want to break you open:
I found a mind I’d like to see,
I found a mind I’d like to explore
endlessly.

I want to break you open
endlessly.
I want to break you open:
I found a mind I’d like to see.

I found a mind I’d like to see.
I found a mind I’d like to see.
I found a mind I’d like to see.
I found a mind I’d like to explore
endlessly.
