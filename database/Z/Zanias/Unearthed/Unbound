Could’ve been stronger,
held on a little longer.
Could’ve been stronger,
held on a little longer.

You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.
You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.

Could’ve been stronger,
held on a little longer.
Could’ve been stronger,
held on a little longer.

You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.
You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.

“It isn’t you”, he said.
“It isn’t you”, he said.

You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.

“It isn’t you”, he said.
“It isn’t you”, he said.

You walk in,
you walk out,
you make me feel it all again,
you make me feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You walk in,

(It isn’t you)
Could’ve been stronger,
(It isn’t you)
held on a little longer.
(It isn’t you)
Could’ve been stronger,

(It isn’t you)
Could have given just a little more,
(It isn’t you)
a little more, little more.
(It isn’t you)
Could have been a little easier
(It isn’t you)
and loveable.
(It isn’t you)
Could have given just a little more,
(It isn’t you)
a little more, little more.
(It isn’t you)

“It isn’t you”, he said.
“It isn’t you”, he said.
