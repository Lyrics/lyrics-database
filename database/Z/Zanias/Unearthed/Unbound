You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

Could’ve been stronger ...
Could’ve been stronger ...

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

You walk in,
you walk out.
You make it feel it all again.
You make it feel it all again.

Could’ve been stronger ...
Could’ve been stronger ...
