I had you done,
I had you figured out.
Are you too full of fear for me now?
Are you too full of fear for me now?
I wish I could be what you need
to feel alive for a change.

I think I might be everything you’re running from.
I think I might be everything you’re running from.

Are you too full of fear for me now?
Are you too full of fear for me now?
I wish you could see what I see,
to feel what I feel.

(To feel what I feel)

I wish you could see what I see,
to feel what I feel.

I think I might be everything you’re running from.
I think I might be everything you’re running from.

I think I might be everything you’re running from.
I think I might be everything you’re running from.

(If only I were enough
to deserve your wounded love.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I were enough.
If only I…
If only I…
If only I were enough.
If only I…
If only I were enough…)
