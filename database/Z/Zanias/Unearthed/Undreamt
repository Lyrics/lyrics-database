Should’ve known and shouldn’t have said,
kept the cards close to my chest.
But against it all I can’t control
that I’m a human and I need to be loved.
I need to be loved.

If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you.
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).

Every time you’re walking by
she’s at your side.
Don’t you look me in the eye.
Don’t look me in the eye.

If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you.
(We’re gonna lose, we’re gonna lose)
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you.
If the game is there to be played
I wanna play it with you (with you).

Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness…
The emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness.
Always second best
to the emptiness…
The emptiness.
Always second best
To the emptiness…
The emptiness.
