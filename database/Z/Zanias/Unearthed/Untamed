What have you done?
What have you done?

What have you done?
What have you done?

I’m stepping out
...
feels good
now I catch a side of you
by the window.
It’s effective,
for sure.

How could I
not have noticed
before
what you are?
What you are.
What you are.
What you are.

It’s effective,
for sure.

Now I catch a side of you
By the window.
It’s effective,
for sure.

How could I
Not have noticed
Before?

You’re making me blush
