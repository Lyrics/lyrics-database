What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?
What have you done?

I’m stepping out.
The night was long
but it was good.
Now I’m catching sight of you
by the window;
it’s effective for sure.
How could I
not have noticed
before?
What you are…
What you are.
What you are.
What you are.

It’s effective for sure.
Now I’m catching sight of you
by the window;
it’s effective for sure.
How could I
not have noticed
before?
You’re making me blush.
