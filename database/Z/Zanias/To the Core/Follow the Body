Soon I’ll wake up,
something aches.

Soon I’ll wake up,
something aches.

Soon I’ll wake up,
something aches.

(I’ve been)
(I’ve been flowing right out of your hands…)

Every cell is telling me “run”.
Every cell is telling me “run”,
how can I turn around?
How can I turn around?

“Listen to the heart”, they say
(flowing right out of your hands…)

Every cell is telling me “run”.
Every cell is telling me “run”.
Every cell is telling me “run”,
but what would I be to you then?
But what would I be to you then?

Every cell is telling me “run”.
Every cell is telling me “run”,
but what would I be to you then?
But what would I be to you then?
But what would I be to you then?
But what would I be to you then?

But what would I be to you then?
