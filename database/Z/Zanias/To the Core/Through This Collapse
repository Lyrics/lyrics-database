Irrational collision course,
I know I’m wrong.
Tainted elemental fusion:
at the molten core (core) I can’t forget what I saw
But I could take her pale, white neck in my hands
and make it so
the lips you touched won’t
feel the draw of oxygen again.

Can’t take my eyes (can’t take my eyes)
Can’t take my eyes off…

Masochistic pull towards the window
collapsing me inward:
dying star
to supernova.

Can’t take my eyes off… (can’t take my eyes off…)
Can’t take my eyes off… or step away from the window.
The window.
The window.
The window.
