Have you gone numb?
Did you get used to me?
I hurt myself with your past
Just so I can feel the heat again

Are you too tired?
To say you wanna sleep with me
I’m missing when you missed the time
You didn’t get to be distant

Reading old texts
Making a mess
Inside my own contentment
Wishing you’d still let your adorations spill
In the things you send

Say what you mean
Don’t confuse me
Are you sick of me or not?
Have you not messaged me
’Cause you’re busy?
Or because you forgot?

Are you falling out of love?
Are you running out of time?
Tell me, do you not care for me anymore?
You’re not thinking about me
I’m thinking about the possibility
You really ain’t that sure
When you say forever
You might just sever
Our life back into yours and mine
So babe, be honest, are you falling out of love?
And are we running out of time?

Running out of time?
Out of time
Am I a chore
You brush under the bed?
Would you rather not talk?
Or talk to someone else instead?

You’re too polite
Or so you think you are
To say it to my face
Will dance to silence in the car

Reading old texts
Making a mess
Inside my own contentment
Wishing you’d still let your adorations spill
In the things you send

Say what you mean
Don’t confuse me
Are you sick of me or not?
Have you not messaged me
’Cause you’re busy?
Or because you forgot?

Are you falling out of love?
Are you running out of time?
Tell me, do you not care for me anymore?
You’re not thinking about me
I’m thinking about the possibility
You really ain’t that sure
When you say forever
You might just sever
Our life back into yours and mine
So babe, be honest, are you falling out of love?
And are we running out of time?

(Out of time)
(Out of time)
(Out of time)

Yeah I’m running out of
Ways to ask you how you’re feeling
To fill the space while you’re not reciprocating
Look at me please
Tell me honestly
Are you?

Are you falling out of love?
Are you running out of time?
Tell me, do you not care for me anymore?
You’re not thinking about me
I’m thinking about the possibility
You really ain’t that sure
When you say forever
You might just sever
Our life back into yours and mine
So babe, be honest, are you falling out of love?
And are we running out of time?

(Out of time)

Running out of time

(Out of time)
