Yeah you got a paper cut
But I stepped on a needle
You show yours off to everyone
But mine’s hidden but deeper
Your friends give you glitter band-aids
You don’t even need
I guess I don’t need them either
But, you know, I mean

It would be nice
To go un-unnoticed
Maybe just for once
It would be nice to go un-unnoticed
Without seeking attention

Send flowers to my funeral
’Cause I know when I die
I’ll lie in my coffin and pretend
That I am on your mind

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Yeah you love all the concern
Your friends give you some more
Do I have to break a bone
To stop being ignored

Maybe I should fish for it
But I don’t have a line
That doesn’t make me deperate
Please give me all your time

It would be nice
To go un-unnoticed
Maybe just for once
It would be nice
To go un-unnoticed
Without seeking attention

Send flowers to my funeral
’Cause I know when I die
I’ll lie in my coffin and pretend
That I am on your mind

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Send flowers to my funeral
’Cause I know when I die
I’ll lie in my coffin and pretend
That I am on your mind

It would be nice to go un-unnoticed (Send flowers to my funeral)
Maybe just for once (’Cause I know when I die)
It would be nice to go un-unnoticed (I’ll lie in my coffin and pretend)
Without seeking attention (That I am on your mind)

Send flowers to my funeral
’Cause I know when I die
I’ll lie in my coffin and pretend
That I am on your mind

Nice to go un-unnoticed

Nice to go un-unnoticed
