Could you love me while I hate myself?
Could you love me though I don’t deserve it?
Could you love me like there’s no one else?
Even though you know I can’t return it

Could you love me when the water’s rough?
Or when I leave you in a desert?
Could you love me though I speak with knives?
Knowing all too well that you’ll get hurt

If you can’t say yes just go
I’m more trouble than I’m worth

Could you love me while I hate myself?
Because I don’t know how this works
I never learned how this works
