You only text back half the times I text first
But you’re the one who offered me your number
Were you bored?
Did you want something from me?
Was it genuine or just out of envy?

You only have time to talk when it’s about you
Invite me to hang out and always let it fall through
Do you only say you like me publicly
No hetero, but what the hell are we?

Am I a convenience or a pet?
A pal or a second thought?
Am I a nuisance or a threat?
Are we friends or not?

Did you mean it then regret it?
Was I always a blind spot?
Have I worn off or gotten promoted yet?
Are we friends or not?

You get excited ’bout me
I let it get to my head
I’m confident until you leave me on read
Did you ghost me to gently burst my bubble?
Did you realize that I’m replaceable?

You say you’ll be there for me
But I can’t ignore the truth
You’re only here when nobody else needs you
I feel like the second-best you’ve ever had
But second best of two is actually just last

Am I a convenience or a pet?
A pal or a second thought?
Am I a nuisance or a threat?
Are we friends or not?

Did you mean it then regret it?
Was I always a blind spot?
Have I worn off or gotten promoted yet?
Are we friends or not?

I’m the last thing on your mind
But the first to call
You know I’d drive to you
Through all the mixed signals
You look at me like I’m the best thing on the earth
When there’s no one else to look at
Is that really all I’m worth?
The only thing I’m taking are the shots you call
So let me ask you
Are we friends at all?

Am I a convenience or a pet?
A pal or a second thought?
Am I a nuisance or a threat?
Are we friends or not?

Did you mean it then regret it?
Was I always a blind spot?
Have I worn off or gotten promoted yet?
Are we friends or not?

Remind me because I forgot

Are we friends or not?
