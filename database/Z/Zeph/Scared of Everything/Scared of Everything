I’m not one to take
Risks or responsibility
I couldn’t even fake it
Even the possibility

Makes me overwhelmed
Overwhelmed
Overwhelmed
Can’t come out my shell
Out my shell
Please do tell me
How to get over myself
Over myself
’Cause right now

I’m scared of everything
I’m backed against the wall
I’m scared of everything
Everything
Everything
Everything at all

I know it’s kind of vague
I don’t know how else to say it
What am I supposed to do?
When there’s not one thing that doesn’t make me anxious

It makes me overwhelmed
Overwhelmed
Overwhelmed
Can’t come out my shell
Out my shell
Please do tell me
How to get over myself
Over myself
’Cause right now

I’m scared of everything
I’m backed against the wall
I’m scared of everything
Everything
Everything
Everything at all

I’m scared of everything
I’m backed against the wall
I’m scared of everything
Everything
Everything
Everything at all

And I want to change
But I don’t know how
I thought I’d try to start by saying it out loud
I shut myself down
How can I break free
When the one who’s scaring me the most of all is me

And I want to change
But I don’t know how
I thought I’d try to start by saying it out loud
I shut myself down
How can I break free
When the one who’s scaring me the most of all is me
