I make time for you
I don’t have to
Cancel plans while you make your own
Sit and wait for you to call me
While you forget you have a phone

Wish I wasn’t so forgettable
Do you ever think about me first?
I know that you’re busy
But that leaves me busy being hurt

Could you miss me for a moment
Just take a sec and stop
To smell the roses
It’s the time, not the flowers that I want

I make time for you
I don’t have to
Every day while you’re running late
There’s so much to do
And so little time
But I’m the thing you procrastinate

I spend all my time on wishing
That you would spend some of yours on me
I know that it’s selfish
But my loneliness would disagree

Could you miss me for a moment
Just take a sec and stop
To smell the roses
It’s the time, not the flowers that I want

Is there time inside your day
To maybe dream about me back
I know I won’t get an answer
But is that so much to ask

(Finally)
