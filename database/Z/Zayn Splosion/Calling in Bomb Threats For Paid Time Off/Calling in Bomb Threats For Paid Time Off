I don’t feel like going to work today,
My boss lately has been pretty fuckin’ gay.
So I think I’m gonna shut the office down
With my little trick of known renown.

I called in a bomb threat from a burner phone,
I scrambled my voice into the microphone.
No reason to worry; I will never get caught,
I know because, baby, I do this a lot!

I don’t feel like working tomorrow too,
There’s so much stuff I’d rather do.
Like sitting on the couch and beating off,
Besides, I think I have a cough.

So I called in another bomb threat, you see,
I think the operator recognized me.
Too bad I called from my boss’s phone,
I mean, why on earth would I use my own?

I called in a bomb threat from my boss’s phone,
I played his voice into the microphone.
It’s not illegal if they can’t prove it’s you,
I mean, those FBI agents never have a clue.

I’ll stay home and sleep until noon,
Maybe I’ll call in another one soon!
Playing hooky has never felt so fine,
Bomb threats are the best way to unwind.

I know it’s risky, but I love the thrill,
The freedom I get, the time to chill.
No boring meetings or deadlines to meet,
Just day after day kicking up my feet!

I called in a bomb threat from a burner phone,
I scrambled my voice into the microphone.
It’s not illegal if they can’t prove it’s you,
I mean, those stupid fucking agents never have a clue.

(Yes, operator, there’s a suspicious package outside Darren’s Hardware Store.)
(Please hurry, I think it’s a bomb!!)

No Teams messages or even mail,
And my dumb boss Brian is getting raped in jail!
The thrill of the game, the joy of deceit!
PTO has never felt so sweet!

I called in a bomb threat from an Android phone,
I scrambled my voice into the microphone.
No reason to worry; I will never get caught!
I know because, baby, I do this a lot!
