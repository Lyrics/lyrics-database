There’s always one kid in every school
Who’s all so full of hate (so full of hate)
Seething rage and vengeful genes
And, yeah, he plays it straight (oh-oh-oh-oh)

His deeds are always sick and wrong
Although he’s just a kid (alright)
He used to be a baby ’til
He burned down his crib (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Clapped his hands and all he said was:
“Finito, (neato) neato (neato)”
Woah-oh-oh
Then everyone fell dead and said…

Don’t talk to him, ’cause he’s a villain
Don’t talk to him, ’cause he’s a villain
Don’t talk to him, (don’t look at him) ’cause he’s a villain (don’t listen to his lies)
Woah-oh-oh
He’s a villain
He’s a villain

Some misguided teacher said
He’s just misunderstood (misunderstood)
But everybody understands
A villain ain’t no good (oh-oh-oh-oh)

And he’s always building
Evil-evil rage (evil rage)
That boy’s not upset, my friend
That boy’s not ok (oh-oh-oh-oh)

Clapped his hands and all he said was:
“Finito (neato), neato (neato)”
Woah-oh-oh
Then everyone fell dead and said…

Don’t talk to him, (don’t look at him) ’cause he’s a villain (don’t listen to his lies)
Woah-oh-oh
He’s a villain
He’s a villain

(Stay away from classroom 5)
Yeah, he’s a villain
(Stay away…)
He’s a villain

[What’s that Janie?
Show us what you got.
A love letter?
Oh, god.
C’mon girls…]
