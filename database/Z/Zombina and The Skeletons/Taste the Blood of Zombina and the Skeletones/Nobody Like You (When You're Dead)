One, two, three, four

Believe it or not, I was a beauty queen, yea
I was the toast of the rock’n’roll scene
I had all the friends that money could buy
But I would trade it all in, just to be alive
If they could see me now
That little gang of mine
You can bet your ass they’d run a mile
If my friends could see me now…

Nobody likes you when you’re dead
It just ain’t right
Just ’cause I’m biting on your head
There’s no need to be impolite
And if I still had eyes
Then I would surely cry
Nobody likes you when you’re dead
And that’s the story of my life

See the repulsion on your faces…
Have you looked in a mirror lately?
Have you ever been a teenage dream?
My daddy was a TV, my mommy was a magazine
The only man that I ever loved was the same motherfucker who cut me up
He cut me up in a special way
He made me what I am today
And if my friends could see me now…

Nobody likes you when you’re dead
It just ain’t right
Just ’cause I’m biting on your head
There’s no need to be impolite
And if I still had eyes
Then I would surely cry
Nobody likes you when you’re dead
And that’s the story of my life

Of my life
Of my life

Nobody likes you when you’re dead
That’s the story of my life
