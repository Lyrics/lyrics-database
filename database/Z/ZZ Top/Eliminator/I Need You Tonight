It’s 3 o’clock in the morning
And the rain begin to fall
But I know what I’m needing
But I don’t have at all

I’m needing someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight

Outside my window
It’s lonely and cold
Inside my heart there’s a fire
Burning out of control

Burning for someone like you
I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight

Your love’s coming to me
Like a wolf howling at the moon
But that just doesn’t do me
If I can’t get you soon

I’m calling for someone like you
That I just wanna do love to
Baby, baby
I need you tonight
