What in the world’s come all over me?
I ain’t got a chance of one in three
Ain’t got no rap, ain’t got no line
But if you’ll give me just a minute I’ll be feelin’ fine

I am the one who can fade the heat
The one they all say just can’t be beat
I’ll shoot it to you straight and look you in the eye
So gimme just a minute and I’ll tell you why

I’m a rough boy
I’m a rough boy

I don’t care how you look at me
Because I’m the one and you will see
We can make it work, we can make it by
So give me one more minute and I’ll tell you why

I’m a rough boy
I’m a rough boy
