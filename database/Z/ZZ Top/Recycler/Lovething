It musta been the way that she kissed me
Made me as weak as a lamb
Tastes so fine like french silk pie
Sweet as strawberry jam
It coulda been the thing that she told me
When she threw her wrench at my monkey

Shoulda been a cool scene
Like honey on a ripped queen
I thought it was a daydream
But it musta been a lovething

I smiled at the way that she told me,
“I just can’t turn you loose”
She was a force majeure in her haute couture
I was howlin’ at the moon
That’s when I jumped out of her window
Before my monkey could cook her goose

Shoulda been a cool scene
Like honey on a ripped queen
I thought it was a daydream
But it musta been a lovething

(It musta been a love thing)

Shoulda been a cool scene
Like honey on a ripped queen
I thought it was a daydream
But it musta been a lovething
