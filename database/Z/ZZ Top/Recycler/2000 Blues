A hundred thousand dollars
Wouldn’t touch the price I’d pay
Of the hundred thousand moments
Of the times I wish I’d stayed

But even if I had all the time and money
It’s still the same old news
Nothing does you any good
When you got 2000 blues

Ten thousand clouds
On a rainy-rainy day
Couldn’t wash away
All the dust and the haze

But I tried and I tried
To search for all the clues
Why I can’t wash away
These 2000 blues

If I had an airplane
With a co-pilot, too
I’d fly to a planet
That was closest to you

I’d set the tracking system
With your safety fuse
And set the countdown
To 2000 blues

2000 blues
2000 blues
2000 blues
