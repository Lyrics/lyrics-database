Hard and cold, like a street of gold
It’s easy to find, but so hard to hold
Smooth and strong, but it won’t last long
When the rust sets in, she’ll be good as gone

Concrete
Concrete and steel
It’s like concrete
Hey baby, what’s the deal?

A heart of stone make you feel alone
But what can you do when your hand is blown?
Hard as ice, it’s like tumbling dice
Before you fall for her, boy, you better think twice

Concrete
Concrete and steel
It’s like concrete
Hey baby, what’s the deal?

Dark as night, diamond bright
Never seen such a strange delight
Slick as glass, and just as fast
You’ll feel the pain, but it won’t last

Concrete
Concrete and steel
It’s like concrete
Hey baby, now, what’s the deal?
