Yeah
Let′s go

I’m unstoppable (yeah)
Do the impossible (that′s right)
I’m irresponsible (oh)
Yet I’m phenomenal (oh)
I got an arsenal (oh, yeah)
I′m dropping bombs, you know (oh, yeah)
No, I′m not stopping, no (let’s go)
Conquer the obstacle (yeah)

To the top, here I go, think I′m chosen
To be the king of rock, think the people have spoken
I can hear the tic toc of the clock, I’m in motion
So, now I′m gonna pop, causing all this commotion, yeah

Yeah, sometimes I think that I’m unstoppable
Yeah, ready to go, man, lock and load
That′s right, I swear to God that I could drop you, bro
Yeah, I got a shot and I ain’t stopping, no
That’s how I know that I′m unstoppable

That′s how I know that I’m unstoppable

Yeah, let′s go

I don’t care what they all say (that′s right)
I’ma do this thing my way (let′s go)
Been grinding hard on it all day (okay)
We work hard then we all play (yeah)
I’m addicted to the grind, man (that’s right)
So, I refuse to waste time, man (yeah)
One day it all will be fine, man (let′s go)
Gotta commit to the climb, man

You know we′re back with the Guinness
Setting records every minute
Every track an addiction
To the fact that we’re winning
Still we lack, something′s missing
Need a track that is hitting (yeah)
Making racks, making millions (oh yeah, yeah)
If you ask, that’s the mission

I don′t waste time, no, I make time
All these people wanna hate, fine, I’ma make mine
While you sitting there complaining, I′ll be training
While you sitting there just waiting, I’m creating, yeah

Yeah, yeah, sometimes I think that I’m unstoppable
Yeah, ready to go, man, lock and load
That′s right, I swear to God that I could drop you, bro
Yeah, I got a shot and I ain′t stopping, no
That’s how I know that I′m unstoppable

That’s how I know that I′m unstoppable
