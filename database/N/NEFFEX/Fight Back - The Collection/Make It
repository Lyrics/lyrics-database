Deep down, I know I’m a fighter
Deep down, I know my desires
Everybody thinks that I’m just a liar
They don’t know what I got inside, yeah
I’m the one to fight fire with fire
I’m the type who never lets me get tired
Mess with me, and they never will find ya, yeah

People tell me I won’t get it
They don’t know me ’cause I’m cold winning
Always in the ninth, I close innings
Always in my mind, don’t know quittin’
I’ma be the one that blows up in it
You can be the one that shows up missing
I’ma be the one that knows my mission
You gon’ be the one with no ambition

I’ma make you take it, take it, take it all back
You ain’t never gonna get me, man, I’m too fast
Call me the juice, that forty yards dash
Always look forward, no, never look back
I just spit the truth, better listen to my facts
Get me up in the booth and I put ’em all on blast
When I spit the truth, they all listen to the wrath
Got nothing to lose, so I put the pen to pad
That’s what I do, hard work always lasts
And the pain’s not an act, no, it hurts real bad
But you have to attack what you want to attract
Or you gonna look back and regret what you lack, uh
Everybody knows that’s a fact, yeah
I just want my words to impact, yeah
I just want my words to all last, yeah
I’m not sorry if I put you on blast, uh

They know just what they see on the outside
They don’t know just what I’m like on the inside
If you knew what I could do, you’d watch your backside
If you knew what I could do, you’d stay in at night
I’m the type of dude you don’t wanna fuck with
I’m the type of dude, enough is enough, bitch
I’m the type of dude who never gets complacent
I’m the type of dude who knows he’s gonna make it, I’ll make it

Yeah, let’s go

Can’t escape from my thoughts, like a black hole
Can’t escape from these thots and these assholes
Too many people feeling entitled
Too many people stayin’ idle
Man, I work every day for the title
And I’ma get it, that thought is final
The way I think, you could say it’s primal
Kill or be killed, I’m your rival

And I don’t lose, no
I’ma be the one they choose though
You gon’ be the one they lose, ho
Way too busy hitting snooze, bro
I’ma be the one to rise up in it
Never gonna fall, I fight till I get it
Always stand tall, got pride, I’m grinning
I don’t really think I’ll ever find my limit

And I know that they all wanna hate me
But they see me on a cloud, so they wait, see
If I make it then they just might say, b
"You been doin’ so good, brother, " ’kay, leave
I don’t wanna hear your words, all the fake shit
Nah, I want my day-oners who been patient
All the same people, never be complacent
We been working hard, man, we’re on the same shit
I’m not just a sinner, I eat you for dinner
I’m not a beginner, I’ll paint you a picture
I got a guitar at eight, played that shit every day
No, I was not that great, figured out how to play
Learned how to change the beat, learned how to rap and sing
Passion is everything, loved it throughout my teens
Ten thousand hours so I could be fucking king
Hand me the crown and just get out my fucking ring

They know just what they see on the outside
They don’t know just what I’m like on the inside
If you knew what I could do, you’d watch your backside
If you knew what I could do, you’d stay in at night
I’m the type of dude you don’t wanna fuck with
I’m the type of dude, enough is enough, bitch
I’m the type of dude who never gets complacent
I’m the type of dude who knows he’s gonna make it, I’ll make it
