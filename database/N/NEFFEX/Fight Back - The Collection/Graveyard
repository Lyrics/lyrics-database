You don′t wanna fuck with me
Don’t wanna test your luck with me
′Cause if you try to fuck with me

I’ll take all your body parts
To a fucking graveyard six
Feet underground

I’m ostracized
And traumatized
By everything I′m not alright
I′m lost inside
And anything
I say you better listen up closely
Mostly I’m the one and only
Bring it home slowly
Hand ya boy the trophy
Patience is holy
Molly
I got ′em hatin’ on me
Like Michael hates Toby
Force like I′m obi
You know the one kenobi
Force fed baloney by phonys

Just wanna rule the world
Call me mister, steal your girl
Eazy gave me the referral
Now he’s worried bout it Gerald yea! Coming out strong
I′ve been here for a long time
Started off online
Finish off all time
They can call me crazy
’Cause I rap like I got rabies
I’m confident not lazy
And I′m dominating lately
She want me like some pastries
I′mma give it to these ladies
Like I’m Hefner in my eighties
′Till I’m pushing up daisies

You don′t wanna fuck with me
Don’t wanna test your luck with me
′Cause if you try to fuck with me
I’ll take all your body parts
To a fucking graveyard six
Feet underground
You don’t wanna fuck with me
Don′t wanna test your luck with me
′Cause if you try to fuck with me
I’ll take all your body parts to a fucking graveyard
Six feet underground

I can taste it
I′m fading
Why am I still waiting?
What are y’all debating?
It′s really irritating
Ya hear what I’m saying
Fear got ′em shakin’
You won’t ever find a fucker like me in the making
Bite me and you′ll break ′em
Your teeth will be vacant
I don’t need to be patient
Man I breed entertainment
From the streets na the basement
OC I′ve been baking
Like ya mommas casserole she makes me after bangin’

Turn on the radio
And you hear some shit
Your throat I′ll slit
If you don’t post this
And I won′t be missed
Hell no I’m pissed
I’m the only rapper in this game
Worth shit, I go it on my own
Don′t need nobody′s help
I do it all alone
I’mma do it by myself
All these lyrics I′mma own
You won’t put me on a shelf
Every punch that I throw
I could send your ass to hell
Better run bitch now

You don′t wanna fuck with me
Don’t wanna test your luck with me
′Cause if you try to fuck with me
I’ll take all your body parts
To a fucking graveyard six feet underground
You don’t wanna fuck with me
Don′t wanna test your luck with me
′Cause if you try to fuck with me
I’ll take all your body parts
To a fucking graveyard six feet underground
