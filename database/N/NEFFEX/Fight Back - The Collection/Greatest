Yeah, I just wanna be the greatest, everybody knows my name, shit
I′ma have this whole fucking game lit
Spitting with insane wit, and I’m gonna be famous

Ain′t nobody able to delay this
Coming up, I had a vision to make it
Never wanted to be nothing, always wanted to play shit
Sit in class always wondering why I learn this lame shit
How the hell am I different if we all know the same shit

I ain’t never let ’em doubt me, it′s about me
Keep my head down, let my mouth speak, they surround me
They all about the clout, see, where the crowd be
Every time I speak loudly, they more about me
Man, you know I got a bounty on these lousy
Ass haters that surround me, still they doubt me
They don′t know nothing ’bout me, still their mouths breathe
I′ma change that soon, better watch out, now see

I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah
Yeah, I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah

And I’m not playing any more games
Either put me on the charts, or I′ll put you up in flames
Better recognize art, ’cause I don′t forget names
Should’ve seen me from the start, coming at you like a train
Think I’m ′bout to fall apart, every single fucking day
Seeing all these damn stars with my well-deserved fame
And I spit these gold bars while they spitting out shame
Man, I give this shit heart, but it gives me back pain

I wanna be a spectacle, they skeptical
But, man, I got the chemical, exceptional
I do it all intentional, professional
So I can make that decimal incredible
I′m not thinking, man, they saying that I’ve gone insane
I′m not ever gonna make it ’cause the game has changed
I′m not good enough, man, no, that’s not okay
Tell me that shit again and I′ll stomp your brain

I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah
Yeah, I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah

Now wake up, you got some shit to do
It’s 6am, I don’t care, you got some shit to prove
′Cause right now you ain′t got nothing that big to lose
So, get your ass to work and don’t you dare hit snooze
Can′t stop this, I’m obnoxious and I′m honest
A novice with a promise, made monstrous

I’m conscious, but I′m nauseas, think I’ve lost it
I’ve got it, spitting all this, still I′m not it
I got this, I will not quit, man, I′m all in
Balling on a budget, man, I’m stalling
Crawling, ′cause I’m nothing, but I′m all in
Calling, I’ll be something, yeah
I′ma get it out now, you can leave if you don’t like it
Say it out loud, you believe or you can bite this
Keep my head down and I keep on going timeless
Make it somehow, I believe it when I write this

I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah
Yeah, I just wanna be the greatest, yeah
Man, I just wanna be famous, yeah
