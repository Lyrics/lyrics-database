Oh you think you wanna start shit?
I ain′t even from this world just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned yeah

Push my self to my limits I’m in it to win it
Forget the beginning its now that your living
Don′t be forgiving
Don’t fear what your missing
A mind like a killer you need to be drivin
10 steps ahead you prepared in the head?
Think this shit through or just wing it instead?
I’m tired of working so hard for this bread
I′m hungry as fuck and fucked up in the head
I′m sick of these lazy bums
They all get nothing done
Waiting to have someone
Take care of everyone
I don’t need anyone
This shit ain′t any fun
It takes hard work to make your self a penny son
And I will NOT be the one with regrets
And i will not hear the doubt or the threats
And I am not one to ever forget
So watch the fuck out or I’m coming for you next

Oh you think you wanna start shit?
I ain′t even from this world just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned yeah
Oh you think you wanna start shit?
I ain’t even from this world just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned yeah

It′s been like driving me crazy
These people complacent
Too many are lazy
But want to see changes
You can all hate me
Your slaves to these wages
You need to be crazy
To head out for greatness
Don’t want excuses
I want to see movement
Just watch like a student
And see how they do it
Need some improvement
We all need solutions
So be the one who can just sack up and do it

You ain’t never gonna STOP me I′ll be found
Claw my way to the top like a rebound
Ima be the one to pop with a new sound
Ima be the one to drop mc′s now

I’m bout to go off in the hills with this shit
Think that I′m lost but Im found in this bitch
Think that I’m not what I say that I is
Think that I got what they need when I spit!

Oh you think you wanna start shit?
I ain′t even from this world just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned yeah

Oh you think you wanna start shit?
I ain’t even from this world just call me Martian
I could kick you down a hole just like a spartan
Fuck with me and you will never be pardoned yeah
