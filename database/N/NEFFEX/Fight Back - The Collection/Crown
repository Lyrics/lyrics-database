Yeah

It′s our time to shine

Yo that’s the kind of state of mind you gotta combine
With hard work and time, you gotta climb to the top
Don′t let yourself drop till your heart stops
Let this beat rock, got a new clock
And a new stock for this new rock
Just let your mind loose from the noose doc
Drunk off the Goose, yeah, thinkin’ that I’m Tupac
Getting caught with a few thoughts ′cause I′m too lost

I’m about to go off, the speakers can′t even handle me
Give it what I got, nobody’s gon′ drain my energy
And I will never stop, I’m motivated by enemies
Setting up shop, so everybody remember me
And no I am not going through life regretfully
I′d rather work non stop, what they call incessantly
Than work some odd job, just to live life pleasantly
Already got lost, in my mind not a fantasy
I’m getting ancy

We’re the forgotten souls, so stop, drop, and roll
Ya lost all control, and pop off your bold
I got squat I fold, I′m not bought I′m sold
My stock rocks it’s gold, hey knock knock behold
It′s tick tock to close, I ain’t stopping though
It′s hip hop you know or is it rock and roll?
I’m not dropping dough, no my pockets grow
You can′t stop the show, so get rocking oh!

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain’t never giving up, I ain’t never giving in
You know I′m take take taking that crown from you
I ain′t worried ’bout yuh, I ain′t here to make friends

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain’t never giving up, I ain′t never giving in
You know I’m take take taking that crown from you
I ain′t worried ’bout yuh, I ain’t here to make friends

Yeah, I ain′t never slowing down, keep on growing till I′m found
Nah I’m never slowing down, ′cause we’re blowing up now
I ain′t never slowing down, keep on growing till I’m found
Nah I′m never slowing down, ’cause we’re blowing up now

I carve words like a weapon, attack with no questions
In my own section, and they still disconnected
′Cause their minds been infected, and they′re filled with objection
Too filled for recollection, so we’re losing all attention
They don′t know I’m in contention ′cause I’m gaining their attention
′Cause I’m making a connection, lyricism and aggression
Got me feeling my ascension in my passion, my profession
I’m attacking my obsession, taking action and progressing ah

I go off on the enemy, that′s what makes ′em scared of me
Make my plans carefully, then execute them daringly
They say I act recklessly, but that’s why I′m effective, see
You can’t predict my tendencies, I offer no transparency
Some people think I′m lost, others think I’ll be a legend
I′m never gonna stop till I’m one above second
And my thoughts at the top but my mind stay present
Don’t let your dreams stop, ′cause dreaming is a blessing

Yeah they doubt me all the same, told me I won′t make a name
But it’s not about the fame, it′s about keeping me sane
So I stay within my lane, feel my blood pump through my veins
Feel adrenaline, no pain, welcome all to my domain

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain’t never giving up, I ain′t never giving in
You know I’m take take taking that crown from you
I ain′t worried ’bout yuh, I ain’t here to make friends

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain′t never giving up, I ain′t never giving in
You know I’m take take taking that crown from you
I ain′t worried ’bout yuh, I ain′t here to make friends

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain’t never giving up, I ain′t never giving in
You know I’m take take taking that crown from you
I ain’t worried ′bout yuh, I ain′t here to make friends

So let me break break break it all down for you
I ain’t never giving up, I ain′t never giving in
You know I’m take take taking that crown from you
I ain′t worried ’bout yuh, I ain′t here to make friends
