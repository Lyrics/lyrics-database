I’m going to kiss the girls, make them cry
Live too fast, still not die - before I get old
I’m going to see you raised above this place
Watch the moments shine upon your face
Before I get old
I’ll watch the sun set over every sea
From every city wall, every mountain peak
Before I get old
The Northern Lights and the Southern Cross
The harvests and the miles of dust
And the blowing wind across the world
So wrap this coat around yourself
And leave what’s done behind
There’s so much left for us to do
And yet there’s so little time
I’m going to pull the fences to the ground
Watch the twisted towers come crumbling down
And start again
I want to be a hero and a villain and a father and a son
Take care of my body and abuse it still
Until everything goes numb
So let’s make this dance and never fear
That there’s any real reason why we’re all here
Live real fast, still not die
Before I get old
