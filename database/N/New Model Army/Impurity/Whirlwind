I felt a shiver in the heat-haze and the waiting time is over
Strange tongues on the airwaves as the voices call from distant lands
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I’m in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below

And so we shutter up the doorways as the ripples move towards us
For a moment stop breathing - She wakes and stirs beneath our feet
The Order try to stand their ground, while every battlefront is shifting
They still believe that they can hold the reins
But then they’ve got no sense of history
So let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below
- the waters seething, bubbling out of control
- come on take my hand and we’ll dive

A television blares in an empty room
The poisoned waters glisten
Goliath staggers round in a punch-drunk daze
Doesn’t understand what hit him
I saw which was the winning side but still I joined the other
And I’m in love with every strange unfolding day
As the storm begins to break cover
Let the whirlwind blow
- through the ice, the melting snows
- across the freezing skies and the tiny lights below
- the waters seething, out of control
- we watch the oceans rise and the governments start to fall
- across the freezing skies until the lights go out below
