She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I’ve been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I’ve been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

Meat-eating orchids forgive no one just yet
Cut myself on angel hair and baby’s breath
Broken hymen of your highness, I’m left black
Throw down your umbilical noose so I can climb right back

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice
Your advice

She eyes me like a Pisces when I am weak
I’ve been locked inside your heart-shaped box for weeks
I’ve been drawn into your magnet tar pit trap
I wish I could eat your cancer when you turn black

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Hey! Wait!
I’ve got a new complaint
Forever in debt to your priceless advice

Your advice
Your advice
Your advice
