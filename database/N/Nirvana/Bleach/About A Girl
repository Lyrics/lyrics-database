I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I’ll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can’t see you every night, free
I do

I’m standing in your line
I do hope you have the time
I do pick a number two
I do keep a date with you

I’ll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can’t see you every night, free

I need an easy friend
I do with an ear to lend
I do think you fit this shoe
I do, but you have a clue

I’ll take advantage while
You hang me out to dry
But I can’t see you every night
No I can’t see you every night

Free
I do
I do
I do
I do
