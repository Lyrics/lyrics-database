Come, as you are, as you were, as I want you to be
As a friend, as a friend, as an old enemy
Take your time, hurry up, the choice is yours, don’t be late
Take a rest, as a friend, as an old
Memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria

Come, doused in mud, soaked in bleach, as I want you to be
As a trend, as a friend, as an old
Memoria, memoria, memoria, memoria

And I swear that I, don’t have a gun
No, I don’t have a gun, no, I don’t have a gun

-ria, memoria, memoria, memoria (No, I don’t have a gun)

Well, I swear that I don’t have a gun
No, I don’t have a gun, no, I don’t have a gun
No, I don’t have a gun, no, I don’t have a gun

Memoria, memoria
