This world means nothing without you
This world means nothing without you
And even though I carry on
My love for you is far from gone

There’s something missing in my world
There’s something missing in my world
While everything else just rolls along
I find it hard for me
To

I find it hard for me to carry on

This world means nothing without you
This world means nothing without you
And even though I carry on
My love for you is far from gone

There’s something missing in my world
There’s something missing in my world
While everything else just rolls along
I find it hard for me
To
