If I take your love, it will be for keeps
I won’t play around, I’ll keep you here with me
Have I been found?
Tell me, who do you really see?

Sunny stairways bring me down
I release lonely sounds
Nobody hears, ’cause no one’s around
No one’s around

If I take control
Is it mine to give?
If you half-believe me
I could never rest

Sunny stairways bring me down
I release lonely sounds
Nobody hears, ’cause no one’s around
No one’s around
