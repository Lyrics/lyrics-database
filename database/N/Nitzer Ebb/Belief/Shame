Your spine shadows
The turn shackles
Your smile’s within
Within your look

Within your smile
Within your look
Within your smile
Within your look

Take it back!
Take it back!
Take it back! (you can’t)
Take it back! (you can’t)
Take it back! (you can’t)

When you smile (you can’t)
When you smile (you can’t)
Take it back! (you can’t)
When you smile (you can’t)
Take it back!

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, don’t come back

You’re back (you’re back)
Who knows (you’re back)
To care (who knows)
Who feels (you know)
To blame (blame me)

Don’t blame me
Don’t blame me
Blame me
Don’t blame me
Blame me
Don’t blame me
Blame me
Don’t blame me
Blame me
Don’t blame me

Don’t blame me

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, don’t come back

Your head visions
Your life’s memories

It hurts nothing
It hurts nothing
It hurts nothing
It hurts nothing

Let it go!

Let it go! (I can’t)
Let it go!
Let it go! (I can’t)
Let it go!

I can’t
When you smile (I can’t)
Let it go! (I can’t)
When you smile (I can’t)

Let it go! (I can’t)
Let it go!

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, don’t come back

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, don’t come back

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, don’t come back

Shame, shame, shame, shame
Shame, shame, shame, shame
