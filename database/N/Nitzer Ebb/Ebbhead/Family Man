Family man

He’s a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

Seeing ass fly by
In a drive by
Fly by night
He’ll give you a fright

Taking out your cash
He’ll stuff it in his stash
Leaving by the back door
Settling up your old score

He’s a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

He knows it all so well
From a spell in the cell
Now can’t you tell
This is hell but just think of the cash

And the friends you can smash
If they’re crossing your path
You’ll get the last laugh
As you’re driving away

Yes it’s been a good day
To die as you try
To get by
Buy to get high

And he’ll lend so that you spend
Your life will depend
On your money made friend
Your friend ’til the end
He knows no wrong from right
Best keep out of his sight

He’s a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

Yeah, and you know his girls love him too
Even when you’re dropping your goo
And you think well, if the judge only knew
But then, do you really think that he hasn’t been there too

With his leather strap clap trap
And a dolly bird sitting on his lap
Her fingertips trips across him like on a road map
Leading down to his old chap

(Ha-ha)

Family man
Family man
Family man
Family man
Family man
Family man

He’s a family man, his wife laments
Never broken any of the ten commandments
Either pushing rock, selling for cock
Or rubbing out, rubbing out, rubbing them out

Seeing ass fly by
In a drive by
Fly by night
He’ll give you a fright

Taking out your cash
He’ll stuff it in his stash
Leaving by the back door
Settling up your old score

Family man
Family man
Family man
Family man

He’s a family man
