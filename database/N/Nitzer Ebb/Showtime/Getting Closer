One step, two steps
Getting closer, getting closer
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie

(Yeah!)

I know what you buy
But I’m not selling
I know what you buy
I’m not gonna try

You never take
You think that you’re just right
You never did
That just right

Is it good?
Done for you
Is it good?
Done for you

You’re gonna miss out
Done for you
You’re gonna miss out
Done for you
You’re gonna miss

I’ve got to say that it hurts
I’ve got to say that it hurts
I’ve got to say that

One step, two steps
Getting closer, getting closer
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie
Let them believe me
Let them wonder if I lie

(Yeah!)

I know what you buy
And it’s wall to wall
I know what you buy
And you know just what you want
Just what you

Who said it matters?
What’s missing?
You’re gonna miss it

Who said it matters?
What’s missing?
You’re gonna miss it

Who said it matters?
What’s missing?
You’re gonna miss it

I’ve got to say that it hurts
I’ve got to say that it hurts
I’ve got to say that
