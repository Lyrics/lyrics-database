Yea

Come on

Wake up, wake up, wake up your heart and come alive

You could steal my car
If only I had one to drive

Drive through the night
Through the midnight air
Screeching and speeding
In the streetlamps’ glare

We come alive
We come alive

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

Turn on, turn on, turn on your smile and come alive

You could wreck my car
If we only both could survive

Bumper-to-bumper
The fumes start to choke
Coughing up the secrets
Of this innermost joke

We come alive
We come alive

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

There’s still one place to try
We can take a ride to loveland (loveland)

(Listen)

Wake up, wake up, wake up your heart and come alive
Turn on, turn on, turn on your smile and come alive

Wake up, wake up, wake up your heart and come alive
Turn on, turn on, turn on your smile and come alive
