Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come

Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come

Mixed up, mixed down
Left-right is the only sound
This is the long, that was the short
Look at us, we’re at the last resort

Listen

Can’t stay, you can’t leave
Judge and jury with no relief
Excuses have no uses
You want control but your strength reduces

Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come

Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come
And then they’ll come
And then they’ll come

Opened up, you shut them down
Left-right is the only sound
This is the long, that was the short
Look at us, we’re at the last resort

Listen

Why don’t you say "fire in the hole"?

Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left!

Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left!

Move that body (move that body)
Move that body (move that body)
Move that body, move that body

Move that body (move that body)
Move that body (move that body)
Move that body, move that body

There’s a fire in the hole
And it’s burning up bright
There’s a fire in the hole
It’s gonna burn all night

There’s a fire in the hole
And it’s burning up bright
There’s a fire in the hole
It’s gonna burn all night

Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come

Once you say
They can come over
And then they’ll come
And then they’ll come
And then they’ll come

Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left!

Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left!

Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left,
Left-right-left!
