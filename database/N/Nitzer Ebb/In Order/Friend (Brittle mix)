Are you my friend
With whom my life depends
This friendship dead
There’s money there instead
What has become
Red wine, whiskey and rum
But we all know
Someone’s gotta go

Are you my friend
The one I should defend
You wanted my word
With that, you weren’t assured
You wanted my name
In magic golden flame
I burned so low
Well how was I to know

Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
But it runs too deep, it’s gone on too long

Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
But it runs too deep, it’s gone on too long

Are you my friend
Will you break before you bend
You wanted my trust
Well, be that as it must
You’re shaking hands
With your head stuck in the sand
I pulled it back
I’ve seen all that you lack

Are you my friend
With whom my life depends
This friendship dead
There’s money there instead
What has become
Red wine, whiskey and rum
But we all know
Someone’s got to go

Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
But it runs too deep, it’s gone on too long

Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
Could’ve been, could’ve been, could’ve been wrong
But it runs too deep, it’s gone on too long

Don’t want you, don’t need you, don’t want you, I don’t need you
Don’t want you, don’t need you, don’t want you, I don’t need you
Don’t want you, don’t need you, don’t want you, I don’t need you
Don’t want you, don’t need you, don’t want you, I don’t need you

Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
Are you my friend?
