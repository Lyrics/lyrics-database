# Open Lyrics Database

Many artists don’t have their lyrics available online in the correct form.  Open Lyrics Database was started in an attempt to resolve that issue through obtaining and publishing song texts by reaching out to the original authors.


### What this project is contributing to the world

| Problem | Solution |
|:--------|:---------|
| Quality of lyrics on the Internet leaves something to be desired, often following the basic quantity over quality paradigm. | Maintain lyrics database as an open source project, let people contribute texts to songs they love; reach out to original authors, kindly asking to share their lyrics with the world. |
| Little motivation contributing to resources that may disappear. | To never lose the progress, make it possible for anyone to easily download the whole database. |
| Lyrics websites are often unpleasant to view due to inaccessible design and large amount of ads. | Create and launch a lightweight open-source lyrics website. |
| It’s generally not easy to maintain quality control over large datasets. | Perform automated checks prior accepting contributions to ensure overall database quality. |
