### What this project is contributing to the world

 - **problem**: quality of lyrics on the Internet leaves something to be desired, often following the basic quantity over quality paradigm  
 **solution**: maintain lyrics database as an open source project, let people contribute texts to songs they love; reach out to original authors, kindly asking to share their lyrics with the world

 - **problem**: little motivation contributing to resources that may disappear  
 **solution**: to never lose the progress, make it possible for anyone to easily download the whole database

 - **problem**: lyrics websites are often unpleasant to view due to inaccessible design and large amount of ads  
 **solution**: create and launch a lightweight open-source lyrics website

 - **problem**: it's generally not easy to maintain quality control over large datasets  
 **solution**: perform automated checks prior accepting contributions to ensure overall database quality
