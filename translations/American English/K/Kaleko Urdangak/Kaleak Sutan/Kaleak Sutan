Bad news on the radio
One sign was enough
To give your all

We knew who was our enemy
We were well taught at home
And as a result, what we became

Young and revolutionary, rebellious nationalists

Setting streets on fire
Nights were lighten up
We clearly knew who was the enemy
War to the state
That was our motto
We were in every front

Roads blocked after school
First the picketers and the police charges
A collective withdrawal, everything was stopped

In this town there weren’t mute walls
All of those had something to say
And now all of them are in silence!

You were by my side, where are you my friend?

Setting streets on fire
Nights were lighten up
We clearly knew who was the enemy
War to the state
That was our motto
We were in every front

Young and revolutionary,
rebellious nationalists
All the generations, let’s stand up again

Setting streets on fire again,
Lighting up these nights
We got the same enemy
War to the state
That is our motto
keep going on the same track

Where are you my friend...
