I got behind my beloved land 
The whistle of the sail again
A sip of cider
to avoid diseases
Letâ€™s cheer up
on our way to Ternua

Mikelune in our sights
The dark winter continues
the anchor hits the rock
Already landed
we have arrived few
to the frozen hell

Oh my! harsh strong Kantauri
has left a mark on our character
row sailors, row!

A forty foot boat
eight comrade in there
row sailors, row
The beast is near
We got the armament ready
life on the line

A whale of five thousand arrobas
cannot be calm by our harpoons
raising sand
the storm has began
to threat all of us, trying to scare us

Closing my eyes, I can hear all the words from all who were drowned
sunken souls are going back and forth

Wish all of our tender tears give them the peace they deserve
on the coast of Navarre, sea of Lapurdi, Biskay or Guipuzcoa

Row sailors, row
On the coast of Navarre

Row sailors, row
On the coast of Navarre

Wish all of our tender tears give them the peace they deserve
on the coast of Navarre, sea of Lapurdi, Biskay or Guipuzcoa

Row sailors, row
On the coast of Navarre

Row sailors, row
On the coast of Navarre
